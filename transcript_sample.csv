"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Kristen. I'm home to have the pleasure of speaking with. Hi, my name is George Cataldo. Hey, George. How are you doing today? Good. Good. So, what are you looking at with? Well, tell me something about your plate. Where are you located? Well, the way that we work is we work with the best breeders all across the country. So, the puppies are kind of coming from all over. What breed are you looking at? A boxer. Boxer. All right. Let's see where our boxers are coming from. Have you had a boxer before? Yes. My Margie just died a few weeks ago. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, George. She, so sudden. You know, she had some kind of a tumor that burst open. Oh, yeah. You know, it just pisses me off. You bring the dog to the vet every year for a physical. They don't find nothing. And then, oh, well, we don't look for that. Who do you look for? I, God, I have a great vet. It happens all the time, unfortunately. Puppies have seizures. Dogs have seizures. They can't bring them in unless they have another one within 24 hours. And then four days later, they have them. Yeah. What I'm looking for, I'm looking for a female pawn. But my problem is talking to other people. I just can't understand it. I want one with a tail. Most of our breeders are going to have them docked, but we can always do that. That's what I mean. It's just, why do they do that? I ask them, why do you do that? Well, I don't know. To me, it's like all the dogs I've ever had, the biggest thing is watching the dog and the dog's tail is wagging. You know, the dog's happy. Yeah. I like the tails, too. I'm on your team, George. But the thing is, with our breeders, they are all going to be AKC registered, and unfortunately, it's breed standard. So, the only two fawn females I have are going to be coming from Indiana, and they're coming from the same breeder, so I'm going to assume that they have both of their tails docked, but I can definitely double-check that. Yeah. So how does this work? If I went with that, how would that work? I have to pay for it to come from Indiana? Well, you have both options. You'd want to travel to Indiana on your own, flying, driving. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to do that. Okay. Well, then we do. So that's how it works. Like, if I bought a dog from California, I have to pay for the plane trip here? Yeah. So any of our puppies on our site, no matter where they're coming from or going to, for us to plan travel, it's going to be a flat rate of $711. Okay. And the price of the puppies that you sell? Puppies, the one named Zoe is going to be $4,000, and the one named Lacey is going to be $3,300. Okay. All right. Well, let me get back to you and see what we can come up with. Yeah, George, want me to send you an e-mail with just everything you need to know about Puppy Spot, how we work and travel, help check everything we do? All right. If you got an e-mail, I got Cataldo. C-A-T-A-L-D-O dot G, as in George, at Yahoo.com. Well, George, I'm going to send you over an e-mail right now. It's going to say, Your Puppy with Perk. I'll send you over the two flawn females as well, just so you can see them. They are really cute. I love foxes. Oh, I mean, they're beautiful, but like I said, everyone I look at, I'm saying, why do they talk these tales? I don't get it. I know. And I read an article and they say it doesn't hurt. Bullshit, it don't hurt. Sorry, you're cutting off somebody's tail. It hurts. Oh, I know, I know. I have a Maltipoo, and she's nine years old. I got her almost ten years ago. But she has her full tail, too. And most of the time, they dock the Maltipoo's tail, and I'm very happy that she has her tail. I mean, I just don't understand. I mean, there's certain breeds, like Doberman Pinschers, Boxers, and to be honest, my belief is, like, you have a dog like a Boxer with the fluffy ears and a tail, it looks happy. And if you get a dog, to me, I look at it, you get a dog that's tail's docked, and their ears cropped, I'm sorry, that just makes the dog look mean. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. And they're such a sweet baby. I love Boxers. Their dispositions are so sweet. They're just big, nice babies. Yeah. All right, well, you just heard me, Deb. Thank you very much. Sounds good. You're welcome. Have a great day.","{'Summary': 'George called Puppy Spot to inquire about purchasing a female fawn Boxer with a tail.

"Hi, this is Brooke. How can I help you? Yes, hi, Brooke. Hey, I'm new to your website, and I just created an account, and I found two puppies that I'm really interested in, and I have never used your site or done anything with it before, so I just wanted to ask a few questions. Yeah, for sure. Let's say you created a lead. Well, I created a login, you know what I mean? So I can log in, yeah. And I think your name came up when you called. Is it Jennifer Mason? Yes, it is. Okay, let me just see if I can find your information here on our website. Yeah, and I can tell you the two puppies I'm interested in. The thing that I'm seeing is I think they're from the same breeder and the same litter, because they all have the same exact information and availability and age and everything and background. Okay, yeah. Which puppies are they? They're Cavalier King Charles Daniels. And is there an ID number? Yeah, what is that? So the first one is 732-968. Her name is, well, her name you guys gave her is Tanya. Oh, I see her here. She's six weeks old. She is precious. She is. And then Hannah is the other one, and it's 732-966. 732-966. Let me see. Yep, that is her sister. Yeah, okay, perfect. Yeah, see, so we want sisters, so they have a little friend. Oh, how cute! We're both retired, stayed home adults. You know, we have no kids and no other dogs or animals in our home. And we lost, okay, well, we lost a dog a while ago, so we want to, yeah, so we're kind of ready to move on. But anyway. I know, sadly, I can relate. I just lost my Cavalier a month ago, and he was 14 years old, and it was so sad. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah, so anyway. It's very hard. It's so hard. Yeah, so yeah, we want the sisters. We have absolutely, we're not doing any kind of breeding in any way, shape or form. It will be spayed, it will be fixed and go to the vet as soon as we get them. Yeah, so, or as soon as it's appropriate. So anyway, what we'd like to do is be able to pick them up close to the kennel because we don't want them flown by a stranger. Where are you located? We're in Arizona. Oh, I'm actually from Arizona myself. That's so funny. Okay, cool. Now, these puppies are not from Arizona. They are from Ohio. Okay, okay, that's okay. Oh, okay, awesome. Yeah, so for a family friend, you know, for a family member, we would drive and go grab them. So we want to take care of them. We don't want them dealt with a stranger. That's what we, we don't want them, you know, we want to be able to take care of them. So is that possible to do that? Yes, for sure. Now, they're only six weeks, so they're not going to be ready until May 6th. Right, that's fine. That gives us some time to plan, too. So that's okay. Yeah, so what I need to do then is just go on for each one of those and fill out the info and. Well, I can actually do that. I can actually do that for you. So. Okay, I would, I need to do the financing option if I can. Okay, were you able to fill out that application? I haven't done that yet. Yeah, we're both veterans. I don't know if they give do anything special for veterans, but we're both veterans. Can I text this number your number? Sure. What is the phone number again? Because I don't have it on here. 928-925-5694. Okay, so what I'll do is I can send you the link to apply for that financing. And then send me a text right back once you're finished, because then I can give them a call and kind of speed up the process. Okay. What you were approved for. So, yeah, I would just put the total amount in for, you know, for both puppies. But they'll approve you for however much, whether it's less or even more. And then if it's less, you just would have to pay the difference. Sure. Of course. Yes. All right. Awesome. Well, I will send that link over and then you can text or call me on. You can text or call me back with any questions. Okay. Awesome. Hold on. Oh, no, this is not a puppy mill. Correct. No, no. We we screen each and every breeder that we work with. We physically go down to their location to make sure that they're not a puppy mill. We make sure that the parents are healthy. They have correct paperwork on it on all the puppies and parents and that they're not breeding any, you know, genetically problem dogs or anything like that. Okay. And my husband has another question. And when they are, dude, have they already had been dewormed and had their first puppy shots or or what? Yep. Yep. They will come and see a registered. It's like a Casey, but it's a CA. They're registered. They'll come with their paperwork and then their vaccine history as well. Okay. But at eight weeks or around there, they probably haven't had their second shots yet. Right. They'll probably get one more set before they get to you. Yeah, because they're only six weeks now because it depends on if the breeder probably started them at six weeks because that's how young you start them at. So they'll probably get one more set and then they'll probably need a couple more with you guys. Oh, yeah, of course. Do I know since you you look at these breeders and everything, but do they socialize these puppies? These girls are sisters. They're from the same litter. Yeah. It looks like there was three girls in the litter. The third sister has already been sold. So it's just these two left. And then they are socializing them with other dogs, other small animals like cats and then kids as well. And I can send you pictures of the mom and dad if you'd like. You want to choose the mom? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know we and like I said, we have no other animals in the house, but we just want to make sure like if we're out taking them for walks or anything, they're not going to be animal aggressive. You know what I mean? Like, oh, yeah, no. I mean, in this breed, I don't even know if I've ever met a Cavalier that was aggressive. They're just the sweetest breed. They're my favorite breed. So I'm looking for another one myself. I had a colored one, but yeah, I'll send you pictures of mom and dad through text message. I already sent you the link to apply for the finance and then just text me back or call me back and let me know once you finish that and I can help you out from there. OK, thank you so much. You're welcome. All right. What is your name? I'm sorry. My name is Brooke. Brooke. And then the phone number that I called. Is that the number I can text? I check your phone if you can, because I said the number that I text on is a different number because it's the number that they give us to text on. So you can't call that number, but you can text back on that number and then you just call me back on the number that you already called on. OK. Oh, yeah, I see it. I got that number. OK. Yeah. OK. We're going to move forward with that. Thank you so much for all your help. No problem. Thank you. OK, bye. Bye.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquires about purchasing two Cavalier King Charles Daniels puppies from the company and asks about financing options and pick-up arrangements.

"Hi, Brooke. This is Sonia Sy calling, or Sonia Halstead. Hi. Regarding Diamond, I have a question. Yes. We're driving to Arkansas on the 4th, no 5th, and we're wondering, let me see, 7th, on the 8th, if we could pick the dog up. Let me check. What is your phone number again? Actually, I'm sorry, I have it right here. Okay, so you're wondering if you can pick the puppy up on the 8th? Yes. Have they called you yet, the travel team? I don't know. What's your telephone number? No, it's Puppy Spot. It's just our travel team. They call, so as soon as you purchase, like pay in full, then we get things moving, basically. Okay. Yeah, as soon as you put pay in full, then they call you and they go over the transportation and stuff like, and the meetup. So that should not be a problem, as long as you just purchase her, like fully, as soon as possible. Yes, I can do that today, but I had a question, too. Is it possible that I could get the $300 credit that I see offering all the time? Let me see. I thought I put it on there. Did I not? Oh, did you? So the $300 promo was for, you'd have to get the pup pack as well. It would still save you a little bit of money. Let me see how much, let me see what it would do. But, and you would still, you would get the pup pack as well, which is very nice stuff, and that gets delivered to your house. Do I have to buy the pup pack? In order to get that $300 off promotion, yes, right now you do. Yeah. So let me tell you what it would be if I got it. Yeah, I read it. It's the leash and the crate, and the bed, and then the blanket, and toys, puppy toys as well. So if I put the pup pack on and took off that $300, it would come out to $1,425.36, and that's your balance. And if I didn't want the puppy pack, how much would it be? Then I would, you wouldn't save any money just because I'd have to take off that $300 promo, and the $188. So, let me see. Shoot, I don't know what, I'd have to, let me see. Yeah, I have to look at the invoice because I haven't looked at it yet. Okay, I just sent, I sent it over to, oh, nope, that's wrong. Ignore what I just sent over. Sorry about that. There were two things that you offered with the puppy that I don't, I didn't want. Yep, so, um, so if you didn't, if I, if you didn't get the pup pack, and with that $300 off, it would be $1,546.60. So, I mean, if I were you, I would definitely go for the pup pack and still save a little bit of money because you end up getting that, all those things, plus saving some money with that discount. What was the other option? There was another option that comes with it. Yes, AKC Reunite Enrollment, and what that is, is once the puppy's microchipped, then it's basically already registering the microchip for you. Because you do have to register the microchip in order for, to have it work. So, you would get the puppy microchipped usually when she gets spayed, and then from there, you would already have her registered with the AKC Reunite Enrollment, which is $49. Okay, I'll do it. Okay. And what was it with the $300 credit? You said it would be $1,400. Yeah, let me just add that I have to put on the AKC really quick. So, it would come out to $1,478.40. Okay, I'll pay that. All right, awesome. And then as soon as, yep, so then you would be waiting for a call from our travel team within a day or so, and they're gonna schedule the meetup. Okay, perfect. Thank you. All right, I will, no problem. I will send it on over. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. You're welcome.

"How can I help you? Excuse me, where are you located? Well, we're actually a remote company that works with breeders all over the US. So depending on what puppy you're interested in, I can let you know where that puppy would be coming from. So, will there be like different stores? We don't have a store, they're with the breeder still. So like they're at home with the breeder. Oh, so they're at home with like the parent. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Well, they're with the breeder. Like do you all have any like I can get like tomorrow or this week? No, it does take a process. So it takes a couple weeks for the puppy to get to you. Okay, so will it be like delivered or will it have to go somewhere? Depending on where the puppy is, we can either transport the puppy to you or you can pick the puppy up. Do you all have any sheep poodles? Sheep poos? Mm-hmm. Let me check. And what was your name? My name's Brooke. Brooke? Okay, thank you. We do currently have about 34 sheep poos. Oh, that's a lot. Where are they? Like, no, they're all around the US. Oh, they're around the US. Yeah, they're different breeders. Yeah, so and transportation is $711 additional. So it just depends on where the puppy is. Are there any in Tennessee? Tennessee? Let me see here. Looks like most of them are coming from Missouri and Arkansas. Arkansas? Yeah, Arkansas. And what else? Yeah, Missouri and Arkansas. Just Missouri and Arkansas? Yes. Okay. Well, how much are like, do you give us the price or do the owners or the breeders give us the price? Well, they're ranging. The prices are all ranging. So, I mean, we have some starting at $2,000 and they go up to like $4,000. What's the lowest price? Let me check. Hold on one second. Okay.

"Hi, this is Karrera with Puppy Spot. Who am I speaking with? Hello, where are you located? So we're not located in one general location. We are a network of breeders throughout the entire country. So it kind of just depends on how much puppy you're looking at. Okay, I am looking at something in Wisconsin. Okay, I don't think we have a whole lot of breeders in Wisconsin, but I believe we have a few. Is there a specific breed you're looking for? Well, I would be most satisfied with English Shepherds. Okay, so you like bigger dogs? I'm sorry? Do you like bigger dogs, smaller dogs? English Shepherds, you mean they're very small, very young, or around a year old? Okay, let me see. I'm not sure that we have any of those right now. We have Australian Shepherds. Australian Shepherds? Okay, how old is he? Let me see. We have multiple Australian Shepherds. I just don't believe we have any in Wisconsin. So Australian Shepherds can range anywhere from like 6 weeks old to 19 weeks old. We have quite a few different ones. Well, I would think about 19 weeks old is what? 19 by 4, 16. Like 4 and a half months, right? Yeah, yeah. That would be good. A 19 week old puppy? Yeah, it could be okay. Okay, so you want a little older, not super young? No, it doesn't have to be super young. Okay, I gotcha. And do you have a preference on gender? Yes, I would prefer male because we have female already, so. Oh, okay, I gotcha. You're just looking for like a little friend for your current puppy? I'm sorry, one more time, please. You're just looking for a friend for your current dog? Yes, and for us, we are like, we recently had to say goodbye to our friend, 14 years old. And, yeah. I'm so sorry about that. I would like to give home to other dogs. Absolutely. So I found this male Australian Shepherd. He's 19 weeks old, and he is $2,000 before taxes and fees. And he's going to be kind of more like a miniature. So his dad weighs 14 pounds and his mom weighs 25 pounds. $2,000? Yes, yeah, that's correct. Oh, I'm sorry, but it's too much for me. I cannot afford that. Oh, okay. Do you have a specific budget you're trying to stay within? Well, much, much less. Like around $500, $600, that's what I could afford. You know, we are retired people. We are on Social Security. We cannot afford $2,000 for puppies. Gotcha, yeah. Well, if you would like, we do offer financing, if that's something you would like to look into. I'm sorry, can you give me your website so I can go and look for it, not to take your time? No, I can text it to you real quick. What's your first name? Okay. What's your first name? My name? Uh-huh. Ludmila. How would you spell that? L-S-L-L-U-D-S-A, dog, M-S, mama, I-L-A. Awesome. I will text you that financing real quick. Let me just pull it up here. You have my phone number, right? Yes, yes, it's the one that we're talking on, right? That's your cell phone? All right, so I'm going to go ahead and text this to you. All right, just let me know once you've gotten that text message. I just got something, yes. Awesome, so that is the link you will follow to go ahead and fill out financing to see what you can get approved for. Okay, and then I call you back, right? Yes, yes, and then just give me a call back once you're ready. Okay, thank you. Not a problem. Thank you, bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about purchasing an English Shepherd puppy in Wisconsin, but is offered a male Australian Shepherd instead.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Angel. How can I help you today? Hi, Angel. This is Betty Rosowska, and we were calling about Clover, which is one of your Bernese puppies that you have available, I guess. But what we're calling about is we don't know where you're located, and we don't know how to go about this. They said you could just pay for it online, but I don't know about that. We thought we should maybe meet the dog and make sure it's the right dog for our family. We don't know if that's possible. Where are you located? So he is currently being raised with his breeder, or she, sorry. She is with her breeder currently in Ohio. And that isn't possible because we do have hundreds to thousands of people viewing the baby, so there's no way we could schedule individual appointments ahead of time for going and meeting, greeting, and stuff like that for safety, and also just, you know, to keep in view that in general with all the people again. So because she's from Ohio, we live in New York, in central New York. Yes. So I mean, we could drive there and pick her up maybe, but we don't know. That's what we're trying to figure out. So that is that we have, it would be a public meetup location, a chosen spot for this breeder because each one has specific meetups to make it safe for everybody. And so that would be in, let me see if it goes and tells me what her meetup spot is. So what it is is that, so I want to the exact meetup location because my travel team has to determine that, and they don't give exactly where it is in Ohio, but I could do it based on, I could tell you about mileage wise. How old do you usually pick up the dog? She's of age already, so she's nine weeks, so they have eight weeks. And so she is already of age. You could just pick her up. Well, it would take five to seven days because what we have to do is we have to process everything. She also has to get a final health visit, a health certificate. And so what it is, you finalize everything for, and then we would go and notify the breeder. My manager would figure out when they can get the final birth certificate. So we would go and discuss all the details behind the birth. So you would, so it would have to be, so then you, how would you then pay for it? You pay for it online or what do you do? So we, you can pay for it online or I can go and send you the invoice over email or text message. We would also, we have to finalize, you have to do a quick screening with a list of questions on the phone, just making sure she's going to a good home and you're aware of our policies. Right. Could you send that to us? No, ma'am. We would have to do it on the phone whenever you've decided you want to finalize for her or after you finalize on the website, then I'd give you the call then, but you have to do them over the phone. Okay. When do you do that? Now? Whenever you decided that you're going to finalize for her, but you want to do it either right before you make payment or right after you make payment. Okay. It's Kevin. They're going to have, they want to have a screening and talk with you about you and Betty about the dog and if the dog is in Ohio, so we could actually technically go get her or meet in part way to get her. And they have a series of policies that they want to make sure it's going to go to a good home and all that kind of thing. And it's not, they won't do the meeting. So they won't go and meet halfway or anything. It's going to be meeting in Ohio. They'll be meeting in Ohio. Unless you want her brought to within a hundred miles from where you are, that's a different travel plan. Okay. That's a hundred, that's, they could go to Ohio. Do we do, do we do a meet on? Do you meet on like a Zoom or a virtual meeting or? We can't do that because like I said, we do have hundreds of thousands of people viewing the puppy. So there's no way we could schedule individual appointments for meeting and greeting beforehand or anything. Okay. So could you send Betty the information? Email it to her and they can look at it overnight and then get back in touch with you tomorrow or the next day. Okay. Is this Sydney Beckwith? Mine's Sydney Beckwith at Hotmail.com. But you, my daughter is Betty Rousowska and it's Betty Beckwith, BeckwithBetty at gmail.com. BeckwithBetty. Betty at gmail.com. All right. And her phone number is BettyRousowska. We put it in on the thing we submitted, but I guess it didn't read it. It's 315-406-9036. So what do we meet? Do we get the puppy after the meeting or do we have to go again? No, what you're going to do is they're going to, you're going to contact, they're going to send Betty an email. You're going to read through what they say and then contact them and then we'll send them the money, I guess, or part of the money. And then we're going to go to their house and whoever we have to go and pick her up. Yes, it's not a house. And also, what were you saying that, so what is it you want me to send her over email? Because that, your explanation towards it, I'm not getting what you're saying for him. Okay. I think you said that you were going to send us, we could either do something on the phone or you would send us something in the email and we can look at it and then contact you back or... No. It would just be going either on the website doing the take me home or you can give me a call back when you decided and that's when we could do the screening and I can send you the invoice then for payment. Oh, I see. Then you send, all right, do you want to do the screening? They could do it now. But it would have, she would have to pay now. Oh, I see. You want to pay now. Okay. All right. She would have to do the screening. So that's why she has to decide if you want to do screening now, we would do that and payment or she can wait and decide and then do the payment online and then I can call and do that screening. Okay. Why don't we do that? Okay. Yes, ma'am. Hello. That's all the profile. Wait, what's your, wait, honey, can you send us a contact information because I got you on the internet and it came up. Yes, ma'am. I don't know if I could find you again and we like Clover. Yes. So I sent Clover's, actually her little whole profile over to the email. So that way you could click on it and go back to her page. All right. Thank you so much. Of course. And if you think of any more questions, just make sure to give me a call back. All right. Now, Angel, you sent it to Betty or you sent it to me? I sent it to Betty and actually it might have went to both of y'all. All right. Perfect. All right. Thank you so much. Yes, ma'am. Of course. All right. Have a good day. Bye-bye. You too.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about purchasing a Bernese puppy named Clover from Puppy Spot.

"Puppy Spot, this is Brooke. How can I help you? Good afternoon. Hi. I was on your website looking for puppies. Where are you guys located? So we're actually a remote company that works with breeders all over the U.S. So depending on what puppy you're interested in, I can let you know where that puppy would be coming from, and we can transport the puppy to you. A.B. Do you have a, let me see, do you have like an ID number? Hold on. Yes. Yes, 732035. 732025? 35. Okay. Little Abby, the Maltese puppy? Uh-huh. Okay, yeah, so that little puppy would be coming from Indiana. And where are you located? We're in Texas. Texas, okay. So, yeah, we can definitely transport her to you, but there is an additional fee of $711 to do so. Mm-hmm. Wow, that's a lot of money. So you're asking for $4199 for this puppy? Yes. Uh-huh. Yep, as in the transportation. What did you say? How do you guys work around the money? I mean, is there any financial or get the money when you get the puppy? Because I was in the company yesterday, and there was a scam. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of scams out there. Puppy Spot, we're definitely not one of them. We've been around for 17 years. So we work with breeders all over the U.S., and we screen them very well. So they're the ones that make the price for the puppy, and then we just help sell the puppy. Okay. So, and we do offer – we don't do, like, payment plans, but we do offer financing if you wanted to do that. Okay. Financing through who, through you guys? No, it's through a third company. We use Terrace Finance Group, and depending on where you live, again, we have three banks that they go through that they would try to see if you get approved from. Okay, because I did a financing one about three years ago. It was a husky. Okay. You bought him through us? No, it was a different company. It was in Florida. I got you. Yeah. So we do financing, but we don't do, like, payment plans. Okay. All right. All right, well, let me see. Let me see. Yeah, can I get a little bit of your information? Have you put, like, your name or phone number into our site at all? I did. You did? I put everything on my list. Yeah. And what's the last name? D-F-D-I-A-Z. Okay. All righty. Cool. I found you. So I can text you my contact information, and if you have any questions or if you want to go ahead and move forward with a puppy, you can let me know, and I can help you out. Okay. So if we do – if I have an agreement, but let me think about it until tomorrow. Okay. If we do an agreement, how long it will take to do this. I would like to have it this by Mother's Day. So, yeah, that's in two weeks. No, that's in – yeah, not this Sunday, but the next Sunday. Yeah. So, I mean, it's possible, but we usually say from the time that you purchase, it takes about two weeks from the time you purchase for the puppy to get to you. Okay. I got you. I got you. I understand. So, I mean, if you purchase right now, it's possible, but it just – we can't promise a good timeframe. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. I understand. All right. Well, let me think about it and then I'll just let me decide it. It's a little bit too high, the price, I mean, all the way, and I can't drive right now. I'm going to drive over there until September. I'm going to Chicago. But in the meantime, I'm going to keep – if I don't make a business with you this time, I'm definitely going to keep looking and see if they have something close from Chicago. Okay. You're in Texas now, though? Yeah, because you guys don't have anything close over here. I was searching and searching and searching and I can't find it. Let me see. I'm just going to search Texas really quick. Because if it was Texas, I mean, I can go and pick it up. Well, we do have – we actually do have one Maltese boy in Texas, and he's a lot less expensive. He's $2,900. $2,900. I'm concerned about the color. He's white. He's all white. It's a boy, though. No, I want a girl. I'm asking for my wife. She wants a girl. Okay. Yeah. That's the only one we currently have in Texas. But, yeah, so, I mean, yeah, let me know if you have any other questions or if you want to go ahead and proceed. Okay. I'll let you know. Thank you for being honest. And, like I said, I mean, I was doing some searching last week, and it was a scam website. So, at that time, I wanted to do a FaceTime, and they couldn't do it. So, they were all like, okay. I could send you, like, an email, a little bit more information on PuppySpot if you'd like. Yes, I would like to do that. Because you cannot trust people anymore, because, I mean, there are so many scams. Yep, that's for sure. Well, I just sent over an email so you can read about PuppySpot. Okay. And, yeah, all righty. Well, I appreciate your help. No problem. You have a great day. You, too. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about purchasing a Maltese puppy from Puppy Spot, but is hesitant due to the high price and previous experience with a scam website.

"Hi, this is Clare. I'm a puppy spotter who is speaking on the line. Hello? Hello. Hi, can you hear me? Hi. Yeah, you're breaking up a little bit, but I can hear you. Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, we had seen a dog on your site, and we just wanted to know if the dog's available and what town you're in, if it's within a distance that we would be able to come visit and meet with the dog. Yeah, so I can always check and see if they're going to be near you, but if they're near you or if they're not, no matter what, we can't allow you to come and visit the dog beforehand. We used to do it. It's just with other people ruining it for the rest of us. We just don't allow it anymore for liability reasons. Puppies were getting sick from allowing too many strangers on the property. Some people tried stealing dogs in the past, so we just had to get rid of it all together. Oh, okay. Yeah, but we do update our photos and videos every two to three weeks. That way you can still get the most recent photos and stuff of the puppy. I see, okay. Yeah. Which particular dog was it that you were looking at? Clifton? Clifton, let me see. You guys can talk. There's other people here, by the way, if you hear other voices. They just don't want to talk for some reason. No, you're good. I didn't know if we were talking to the breeder directly or if it was a service or like. Yeah, so this is a service for breeders to use. We're a network for breeders to use this in general. So we actually kind of manage them in a way. They'll apply to be working with us. And then from there we do an interview process with them. We screen them. We quiz them. It's a very, very, very lengthy process. We get their licensing information, registration information. We get their vet information. And then we have to do like an interview with the vet to make sure that they're, you know, actually with them. So they're not, you know, lying to us. And then we'll also send out one of our employees to their physical property to do a property tour to ensure everything's up to our standards. And then from there we'll accept their decline them. And do you, does the buyer also get to see like the health and the records of the fire and the, you know, the parents? Yep. You'll get all of the paperwork and everything you'll need when you receive your puppy. So typically, you know, if the dog's too far from you, we'll transport them to you. So once you have your dogs, you'll get like a big old folder of all of the paperwork as well. Everything you'll get the health certificate, vaccination records, registration information, like purchasing information, everything. Okay. Now let me see. So Clifton, the Aussie doodle, right? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. He's cute. Oh my God. The one of him running. That's so cute. So just so you know, and I'm sure you're already aware, but just to give you a heads up with designer breeds, like an Aussie doodle, the AKC does not recognize them. So he will not be able to be registered with the AKC, but that doesn't mean his parents will be able to see him. It doesn't mean his parents weren't registered. I believe they both were. It's just they don't recognize designer breeds through the AKC. Right. Yeah. So both of his parents are registered dogs though. Okay. And he is available still? Yes, he is. Got a lot of people looking at him, but he is still available. Yeah. He's got 1,112 people click on his profile. Though if you guys liked him enough, I wouldn't be surprised if 500 of it was you. No, I'm kidding. I do that sometimes. I'll look at the like amount of views they've had from a dog, and if it's like one that I keep looking at, I'm like, oh, I thought half of that was me. Yep. Okay. Yeah, have you guys ever had an Aussie Doodle before? No. We've had a Golden Doodle, not an Aussie Doodle, so I would like to read my daughter's here. I know she's really interested. So we're going to read a little bit more about the breed. And I'm not sure how big he would get. I haven't really looked at that. Oh, yeah. So his mom is about 45 pounds, and his dad is about 55 pounds. So he's kind of all in that range there. And is he in the northeast? He is in Wisconsin. Where are you guys at? We're in Massachusetts. Oh, okay, I gotcha, yeah. So we don't really have any licensed breeders up that way. Most of the breeders do reside in the Midwest, kind of Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Missouri, places like that, just because, I mean, no particular reason. I'm assuming it's just because it's all farmlands here. Everyone here has like a minimum of 50 dogs. I live in Missouri myself, so I'm familiar with a lot of dog breeders. Okay. And the price that's on him, so that doesn't include the travel, right? No, that would be an additional cost. And it is just $7.11. It's a flat rate no matter where the pup is at. So $7.11, and that covers the transportation and the health certificate that the veterinarian would write up for you. Okay. All right. Any other questions, you guys, today? No? What did you say your name was? Brenda, what did you type in? Or it doesn't matter. My name is Brenda, Brenda Teeman. Okay, awesome. How soon are you all looking to get a puppy right now? Probably, you know, within the next couple of months. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. So I can tell you, Aussie Doodles and Golden Doodles, not too far off. You know, they're not super different. I guess you could say the only difference I could see is maybe an Australian Shepherd. They're typically easier to train than a Golden Retriever, so they might be a little more obedient than a Golden would. But that's really the biggest difference I could see. I've actually have had Australian Shepherds in the past. They're great dogs. Really, really, really, really great dogs. Yeah. Yeah, and they're working dogs. So they do need a lot of energy to get out. But if you've had a Golden Doodle before, I'm sure you're already familiar with that because Golden Retrievers have a lot of energy, too. Yeah. They like their walks. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they definitely do. Yeah. Well, thanks for your help, and we're going to consider and think about him, and we're going to figure it out. So thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Is there a good time for me to follow up with you at all? No, we'll call back.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Alan speaking. How may I help you? Alan, hi. Good afternoon. My name is Bella and I'm just looking at the website because I was interested in adopting a Shih Tzu. Okay. And I'm looking at the male eight week Shantan. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right. Do you have an ID number there? 730-864. Okay. Yeah, I don't even know how to pronounce that. X-X-Xantan or something like that. Okay, eight weeks old. Now, where are you calling from? I'm actually in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Okay. And do you have anything up in the state, in the US? Any home or family or anything? Because we don't ship overseas. Not really. So, we don't ship. You only what? We don't ship overseas. No, I'm coming to get the dog. Okay. Well, you would have to come to Indiana. Oh, the dog is in Indiana. Yes, at the breeder's location there. Yeah. So, that's where. I would. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I didn't want to go all the way there. Yeah, unless you have some family. I was thinking of Florida or New York or, you know. Right. I mean, we can get the dogs from Indiana to those states, but you have to have a family. We don't just send them over to the airport for you to pick up. So, it has to have a physical address that we need to, and somebody has to sign off on it. Okay. That's the only thing. Yeah, that's not a problem. I can have an address in Florida. That's okay. I could do that. We can use that. But also, it does take about two to three weeks for delivery. So, it's not something. Oh, yeah. That's fine. I mean, you would know ahead of time, you know, when the dog's coming. So, that's not a problem. Yeah, we could do that. That is easy. That's fine. I mean, so you would have the price of the puppy, but we do charge $711 to have the dog delivered down to wherever, you know, to Florida. Okay. But it would be like in a central location, somewhere within an hour to two-hour radius around your home. We don't do home delivery anymore. We stopped doing that. Okay. So, but like I said, you would know ahead of time, enough time to know that when the dog is coming to your area. Okay. So that you can plan that way. They come up to date on all vaccinations. You would get a copy of that. They come with a state-issued health certificate, their vet check before they leave the breeder's location. You can get a copy of that. And then we do give a 10-year health commitment, but I don't know if that would count outside the states. Okay. Now, if the dog is already, like Shantan is already eight weeks old, do they start the training process or they don't do anything? They do a little bit. I mean, the dog's been socialized with children, socialized with other dogs, other animals, has been stimulated. Yeah, because I have a four-year-old daughter. Okay. Yeah. No, they've been around that. He's microchipped also. Potty training is a little bit outside on grass. That's really what they don't do home potty training, and we don't guarantee anything like that. Okay. But, you know, enough to when he comes to your house, he adjusts. He'll adjust pretty well. I mean, he's been around kids. He's been around adults. The breeder says here his puppies are socialized with children of all ages regularly and are raised for health and raised with love. Okay. The parents actually have been tested for their heart and knees. So that's a testing breeder has done for the parents. So right now he comes from a litter of four. He weighs about three and a half pounds. You also get a sample of food just to get you started. It's called NutriSource. And then he like I said, he's been stimulated. And the only thing that we would require is just that we do ask that you get the dog vet check like within 72 hours after receiving him just to because what we want to do is make sure when he comes to you that everything is the same as what we pay. So I don't know if you have any local vets or you can find a local you can actually use Banfield. At least for your first visit because we work with them. They're giving your first visit for free. So that might be something. Okay. What is it called? Who are they called? Banfield with a B. B-A-N-F-I-L-D. And they're located everywhere? Yes. They're a nationwide company. They're usually located in like the PetSmart stores. And that's actually on our website. So if you go under special offers, you click on that, you'll see Banfield. Click on that. You type in your Florida zip code. It'll tell you what vets are in the area. And I have a quick question. So Shih Tzus are usually good with children, aren't they? Correct. Yeah. So they're good families. And I am in an apartment. It's a two-bedroom. But I'm on the beach. So like they're shed free as well, right? Right. These are hypoallergenic dogs. So they're hair. So it's not fur. And it's no dander. And he's going to be small enough for an apartment. So that's fine. Yeah. I like yeah. Okay. So I'm just going to ‑‑ I have to do the paperwork over here in Turks and Caicos because I have to bring the dog back in with me. So that could take me a week or two myself. Okay. So the other thing I would tell you, I mean, I can't ‑‑ I mean, we can't hold a dog. But the type of thing, if you want this particular dog, then I would suggest, you know, pay for it. And then you do the paperwork. But that's your decision. I'm not sure. You know how that works more than I would know. I don't know how. Yeah. Because I'm sure they're going to ask what kind of dog it is. And they might ask you for some other things. Yeah. So I'm going to get all that. If I want to reserve this dog, I need to pay for the dog, right? Right. So you would pay the price of the puppy, which is $27.49. The $7.11 to have the dog transported down. I would need your Florida address. And then the tax in Florida, which is 7%. Okay. Those would be your charges. I won't even push the ‑‑ we have a pup pack, which is a bed, blanket, and all that stuff. But that comes separate. So. That's separate charges? That's, yeah, that's $188. And that would come by FedEx to your house. Okay. So let me look into this a little bit, and then I will call you back. Okay. Yeah, what is your name? My name is Bella. Okay. All right, Bella. My name is Alan. Let me know. And one way or the other. So let's say if I give you an address in Fort Lauderdale, right? Mm-hmm. So you deliver it near Fort Lauderdale, basically. Correct. It won't be at my house. It won't be at your house, but it would probably be close to Fort Lauderdale, because that's the only area that we would deliver to, that area. But I don't make that decision. We have a travel group that reaches out to you about 10 days after you make your purchase, and then they would tell you where the travel was going to be. And then they'll tell you what date and all that. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Thank you so much. All right. My pleasure, Bella. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': ""Bella inquired about adopting a male Shih Tzu puppy from Indiana and discussed delivery options to Florida.

"This is Clara with Puppy Spot. Who am I speaking with? Hi, my name is Beverly Prelowski, and I want to talk to you, but not about a puppy. A few years ago, you had a program called Seniors for Seniors, and it was older dogs that you matched with older people. And I got one of those dogs. It was a beautiful black and white, beautiful thing. And I feel terribly guilty. I feel like it's my fault that he died. I went to work one day, and I didn't have a sitter. Usually, I have my granddaughter come and sit with him, because I had two dogs. We'd sit with them when I was at work, but she couldn't come that day. So I had to go to a parking lot. Oh, that's OK. I built a little shade for them outside on the patio and put food and water, and they were in the shade. And Victor, the dog, the Cocker Spaniel, had his ear canal removed. He was deaf in that ear, of course, and it was constantly infected. So the vet suggested that we just remove it. He couldn't hear anything out of it anyway, and it would be less painful for him. So this was, I have forgotten what day. It was a Saturday. That's right, because I don't usually work on Saturdays. But it was a Saturday. And the surgery to remove the cast on his head was scheduled for Tuesday. I got home from work Saturday, and the dog had been alone all day. I had a barbecue pit that had a grill at the bottom of it with a round and round and round thing. And his head was stuck in there, and he strangled. And I was very upset. The vet told me that it was probably just itchy, because it was a cast, and he was trying to scratch. And so it really upset me. But he was the sweetest. I live in San Antonio, and there's a little town called Shirts, not far, maybe some eight or nine miles from San Antonio. And they found him wandering the streets in Shirts, and he was all cut up and bloody. He'd probably been in a fight or something. And bless his little heart, I don't think he's ever been in a home before. I had another Cocker Spaniel that got along very well, and a little Shih Tzu. He loves everybody. And one day, and my other two dogs played with their toys all the time. Victor never did. He never did. I don't think he knew what a toy was. And then one day, he had a toy in his mouth, and he just pranced around in front of me, like, look what I did, Mommy. I know what this is for now. He was so sweet. Do you still have that program, Seniors for Seniors? Unfortunately, not anymore. Now we just deal with puppies from here on out. We don't have any older dogs anymore. Did you say, I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you. Is there a place that I can get a grown dog? I really don't have the patience. I'm 80 years old. I don't have the patience to take a dog out 50 times a day to teach him. I'd rather get a dog that's older and already knows how to go to the bathroom outside. Do you know of any places? You know, I'm not entirely, I'm not super sure about some places that do that. Let me see. Let me see if I can find anything. OK. You know, there is actually a website called Pets for the Elderly. Oh, really? Yeah, you can look into that there, maybe. But I know we don't do that anymore, unfortunately. But there's also another one called Muttville, where they do Seniors for Seniors. Yeah, there's a few different options. I would just kind of Google Seniors for Seniors and see what websites pop up. OK, and you said that second thing was called Muttville? Yeah. M-U-T-T-V-I-L-L-L-E? Yep. OK, OK. I'll check both of those places. And if they don't do it, they might note somebody. I really do thank you for your help. I appreciate the time. Yeah, sure. Thank you so much. Absolutely. You have a great day. I will, and you too now. Bye-bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about Seniors for Seniors program for older dogs, representative suggests other websites for adoption', 'Rep_name': 'Clara', 'Sale_status': 'No'}",Customer inquiring about Seniors for Seniors program for older dogs.

"Remember calling Puppy Spot, no one speaking? Hello? It's a reader, somebody called me, Paul. Someone called you? Not me, that's for sure. It was Paul. Paul keeps calling you? Yeah. He said that he had fluffy boys and not fluffy girls. He has what? He had them fluffy boys, but not fluffy girls. Okay. So let's see here, hold on one second. Let's see if he... I don't know, unless you have... You've got three accounts here. One you as a customer, one was a cancellation, and then one I set up a new account for you. So I don't see where Paul's calling you, but unless he... I can read what he wrote, what he texts or calls, whatever. And that's your number. Well, let me check. Let me ask him. So give me one second. Okay. How are you? Good. Let me see what he says. He did. Are you sure it's today? Yeah, because now I was sitting here on the couch. Why would I make that up? I mean, that's really. I didn't even know who Paul is. Well, you talked to Paul one time, but because he takes me and. And he said that's Paul. And then he done it again. And he said he didn't have no female. The only one he got is male. All right, so did he give you a name of one? Like a void. The dog, because right now. All the dogs that I have, the latest ones were two days ago. Which is what I talked to you about. No, he didn't say nothing about the name. The only thing that. Well, have you been. Have you been looking on the website because you weren't. Were you interested in male? Were you interested in female? You didn't tell me female or. Yeah. I tell you what I found this. And they have all kinds. Oh. Bluffy one. The only thing they say they're for sale. And I don't know how to do it. How to get with them to. I don't know. You got to be careful with those things. So I haven't. I haven't bought nothing. No, that's okay. Look, just like I told you before, either go on to the website. Look at the dogs because there's always dogs showing up. It seems like every couple of days we're getting new dogs. You have to make that decision whether it's a dog that you think. You would be happy with. Whether it's. You can break it down. You can do just. You could put it in as gender, just female. Yeah. You had the other one. You had the cute one. And. They have me. It was gone. Demi. Right. And. And the other ones that are already gone, you know, I can't help. I know. No, no. So, you know, I look at your side. No, I do. I know that. So. Well. What I want you to do is you have to. What I would prefer you do is that you, when you take a look at the. When you see something, then you call. And call me. And then we can look together. Okay. No, that's the best way not to call in and talk to somebody else. And, you know, so. I called this number. Yeah, call the number you're calling in. As long as the only way you get somebody else is if I'm not here. That's pretty much. So, other than that, if you call the number and I'm working. I'll pick up the phone or I will, if I'm on the phone with somebody, it still rings into me. And then I can just put them on hold and tell you that I call you back. So, I get. He thinks he is. So, oh, gosh. So. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't. I didn't know it was you. No, I just want to make sure. You know, I haven't I've been off since Friday. So, I just got back. So, I don't really know. You know, if you're getting. Normally, there's another account or if if Paul is emailing you or texting you or something. It would be on the same account that I'm looking at and there's no there's only only one account for you. That's all there is. So, I don't know where he's. He he takes me more than one. Yeah. Let me just. I never heard of. Until the first time. So, the last time you purchase, you know, you purchase from me, then you purchase from Keldon. And then we can't go. That you can't. Right. I went to the hospital. Right. Right. Yeah. So, then after that, you and I talked again. And then. That's it. We've just been going back and forth with trying to find you the right puppy. Yeah, but I am looking for. He he he takes me. Right. You're not doing it. Yeah. So, I don't show any. Unless it's under your husband's name or something. I don't know. You have any other accounts. Let me check. You're the only. Three or eight. Three or eight. What is he at four three eight two. All right. What's the number? Hold on one second. What's the area code? What's the area code? Nine one oh. Three oh eight. Yeah. Three oh eight. Three oh eight four three eight two. Okay. Hold on. Four three eight two. Uh huh. And his name is George Jones. Well, that's the. That's the one that you use under Kelvin's number. So, yeah. So, I don't have that under. I mean, I can add that number. Are you using that number? That's your husband's, right? Yeah, that's my husband's. Nine one zero three oh eight. Eighteen sixty two. Right. Yeah. So, yeah. The only time I see his number is under the one that you purchased from Kelvin. Uh huh. Sometimes he has my phone and I have my phone and. Okay. Well, I'll put him on your account too. So. And he's George, right? You said? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. And I'm sorry, but that I. Of course, I feel so bad. No, I just want you to. Look, I want you to get the dog that you want, but I need help from you to take a look at the website. If you see something, just reach out to me and we'll find it. You got me that dog, didn't you? Yeah, I got you Lantana. Yeah. Lantana. And that's what I want. Another one. Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. Well, look, I'm checking every couple of days to see if there's any new things there. And if I think it's something that you'd like, that's why I always reach out to you or I send you the parents' pictures so you can see. Because a lot of the new ones coming in right now, they're just so young, you can't really tell. You know. I tell you what, but this dog is the best thing I swear. And the other one, when she don't come in from the yard, and I tell Rico, go get her. And he go and he gets her and he gets her in the house. It's so cute. I wanted another one like that. I know. And right now, it's a California breeder and unfortunately, I don't have anything from her right now. So. Yeah. Now I have seen on several sites on the internet. Right. There is several like this. I just don't know how to buy and it says for sale. And then you go and you put it on like when you go buy in the store and add it to your cart. Right. That's a scam. And then they check out and there's nothing there. Right. So you have to, if you use anybody else, you got to make sure that they just have a major credit card. That's basically what it is. I know. I know. Okay. I don't want you to get so wrapped up in getting a dog and then you get scammed. That's the worst thing. I know. I almost got scammed. Right. Right. You were telling me. So, all right. Well, right now the dogs that are there are, which I think I called you on because they just came in the last time you and I talked two days ago. That's the latest dogs I have right now. So. All right. But I have you down to take a look again on Tuesday. All right. I appreciate it. Okay. We'll be in touch. I didn't call or. All right. Well, he hasn't responded back to me, so I don't know. I have not. I have not. Okay. But I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. You have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. You too. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': ""The customer called to inquire about a person named Paul who claimed to have fluffy male puppies for sale.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Alan speaking. How may I help you? Hey, good evening Alan. I'm just calling about a puppy I was looking at online. I was just hoping to get some more information please. Sure. Which one were you looking at? His ID number is 732400. There. There? Labrador Retriever? Okay. And let's see. And you called in let's see. You're familiar with the process? Because I know it says here you called in about a week ago. So I just want to make sure. Did they talk to you how it works or not really? Not really. I called a few weeks ago with the same kind of question about a different dog. But if you could please walk me through it. So basically we are a network of breeders. We screen and background check the breeders that we do work with. Our company's been in business over 17 years. A plus rated on the Better Business Bureau. Every dog we sell comes to you up to date on all vaccinations. Comes with a state issued health certificate. You'll get copies of both. We give a 10 year health commitment that covers any type of hereditary or congenital issues that are considered life threatening to the dog. Now this particular one is coming from Tennessee. Also you'll get a sample of food. Bear came from a litter of 11. And Diamond Dry Puppy is the food that he's eating right now. He's stimulated for outside noises, socialized with children, other animals, other dogs. Will be microchipped when he comes to you. Being potty trained outside on grass still has his dew claws. Being 8 weeks old he is available now to leave the breeders location. You have a choice of going down to meet the breeder at a central location in Tennessee or we do transport the puppy up to you in also a central location within about an hour to two hour radius around your home. And that's everything. We take major credit cards, PayPal, debit, all secured sites for you. We do require full payment once you make your decision. We do about a 15 minute screening process. Okay. Sounds good. And so how do I learn more about the breeder? Basically the only thing I can tell you about the breeder is like I said Tennessee. Let's see. AKC registered breeder. We don't give out the name of the breeder because that's what you're paying our service for. The breeder though has been with us since 2017 and is strictly Labrador Retrievers. That's it. That's all they breed. Are there any other breeders that have gotten dogs from this breeder that I could refer to to make them more accustomed to who the breeder is? Is there any? I'm sorry I got cut out at the beginning. I just are there like reviews from anyone else that have gotten puppies through you guys from the breeder? No, the reviews would be about Puppy Spot because once the dog leaves the breeders location, Puppy Spot is responsible for the dog. So we handle everything. It's out of the breeders hand. So that's why we want to make sure that we're dealing with top rated breeders and that the dogs are coming to healthy and with no issues. Sorry. The prices listed here, is that like a firm price? Is it negotiable at all? Let's see if the breeder is doing anything. The breeder is not offering anything. I can offer a $300 discount on our end, but that's about it. Okay. And then what's the cost look like for transportation? Does it depend on the breeder? No, actually with just a flat rate. So it's $711 and then you would have your tax in Connecticut. And everything on what I've been talking about is on our website underneath Puppy Spot Promise at the top. And you can read about the travel, the health check, the health commitment, our terms and conditions, standards for the breeders, and so forth. And when you said tax, you meant the sales tax? Yes, your sales tax. Okay. And that would be on the purchase of the puppy? Purchase of the puppy and the travel. They do it on all. Okay. Sounds good. Do you have any videos or pictures, additional pictures of the puppy? Yeah, give me one second. Let me see. Videos I might have to request. And it looks like, yeah. The last picture is these are two weeks old, so I have to request because they're supposed to update up to every two weeks. So I can request that and go from there. But just so you know, it is a first come, first served. So some people want to wait for videos and photos and other people don't really worry about it. But I'll go ahead and put in an order to get updated photos and a video. And as soon as I get them in, I will let you know. Sounds good. That'd be great. If you could also request pictures of the two parent dogs, that would be great as well. I can send those out to you now. I have those. Oh, you do? Yeah. Give me one second. You want me email or text? Text is yeah, either way. Now the weights of the parents are on the on the website, but they're also on the email. They're just not going to be on the text. So let me I'll send you the text to give me one sec. Gotcha. Okay. So that is actually my mom is actually like a yellow lab. And dad is the darker. Gotcha. And I just sent it to your email also. Awesome. All right. Thank you. Yeah. If you can get those updated pictures, that'd be great. And I look forward to hearing from you. Okay. Very good, Sam. Thank you. I'll get that out. All right. You're welcome.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquires about a specific puppy and asks for more information about the breeder and the purchase process.

"Hello, this is Lisa from Peppermint. Hi, Lisa. My name is Adriana Harmon and I had inquired about one of the puppies. Sure. Let me look. I am... Alfie. Alfie, yes. So I wanted to reach out because I just had a couple of questions that I wanted to address with you and make sure I'm making the right decision. Okay. So I wanted to know just if you have more information on Alfie's background. One of the things that's really, really important to me is I really want to make sure that he's not from a puppy mill. And if he comes from a healthy, safe background. Do you just have more detail in his background? Yeah. So our company is... What we do as a whole is we screen and vet every single one of these breeders on our website. So they're chosen. They're not just put on the site. So we've been in business for about 17 years. So we make sure that we're doing background checks on our breeders, either looking for violations past or present. We're checking Google mapping. Sometimes just on Google map, it's a hard no that we don't have to continue even trying to vet them. Once everything looks good on paper, we start doing site visits. So we have a breeder advocate team. They're traveling the country. They're literally building relationships with all of these breeders because it's important that we do have relationships. It's not just random people with a box of puppies. So we're checking the lines of dogs that they're breeding. We're checking the environment that they're living in. We're making sure the moms are not breeding back to back. We want the parents loved. There's no other way to do it. Yes, it's a business. Yes, it's a for profit business. It's a business. But it has to be based off qualities of life. And if it's not, they're not on puppy spot. So we deny 90% of the breeders out there. So to answer your question, we absolutely have no tolerance for any kind of substandard practices at all. And the screening is done routinely. So it's not just once. That gives me a lot of confidence. But do we have a written record of this puppy's history? Am I able to get in touch with the breeder directly? Okay, so to answer your question, we don't give the breeders information out because our whole business is based on the privacy of the breeders. And if we said, here's a list and the contact information of the top 10% of the breeders in the country, we would not still be in business 17 years later, as honestly as I can put it. But we're giving you 10 years against congenital and hereditary conditions. So we're standing behind every puppy on our site. So all of the puppies vaccinations are going to be up to date before they go home. Every puppy gets a full nose to tail health evaluation the week of travel. So we do deliver to New York. So the puppies are going to have, or the vet rather is going to check their heart, lungs, joints, fecal exams, genitalia, body condition, teeth alignment, vision, hearing, literally everything. And our own health team is going to review the report. If there's anything, even if it's minor or out of the ordinary, you have to be notified. And if you're not comfortable moving forward, you don't move forward. And if it's something major, we can't let you move forward. All the copies of everything come home with the puppy and the breeders information is going to be on there as well. We just don't give it to you before the puppies are home. Now I have, you know, different breeders have different, they all have the same standards. Different breeders do different things. So some breeders do like OSA certification, additional health testing. Some of them could be canine care certified. Now some go above and beyond, but they all have to have the standards that we set. Some are, you know, go over, but you know, they, they're the ones that are pricing their own puppies. They're all gorgeous. The King Charles Cavalier is one of my favorite. And all breeds have their own certificates, so to speak. I know, you know, every, every dog breed can have health issues, you know, inherit to the breed, but we make sure that the parents don't, that they're not passing on anything. So, okay. That makes me feel good. And you said, I won't be able to get the health information until the process starts. Yeah, you're going to get all the puppies health certificates when the puppy's home, because the final exam is done within the week of travel and the vaccinations and all that has to be as up to date as possible. So there's no point in giving it to you ahead of time because it's going to be missing a lot of information. I'm more so wondering about the history, the health of the parents and the health of the line. Yeah. So this line does not have any extra certifications, but they're all getting regular veterinary care. Okay. They, you know, they all have to have, you know, clean health histories and they have to get, you know, their yearly checkups. But like, again, like I said, I do have others that have more. So if you're more comfortable with that, I could show you that too. So my job is I'm your personal puppy concierge, whether you choose Alfie or another puppy that's on our site, you know, same breed. Maybe the parents have more of a history that makes you more comfortable, but all of them have the same criteria and all of them come with a 10 year health commitment. So, and I'll give you an example. Let's say you take a champion bloodline puppy that the both parents have been shown and they've had, you know, champions in their lines and they've had every, you know, health testing known to man. Does that mean that puppy can never have a health issue? No, it doesn't. No, no, I understand. Right. It's nice to know, but you know, all of them have to still have the same standards. Right. Right. Right. I just want to make sure that I'm, and you've given me confidence that I am, that I'm, you know, buying into a system that's, you know, fair to the dogs. Yeah. We're all animal lovers here. My own dog is from Puppy Spot. Huge, huge animal lovers. Yeah. And you contacted us also before, like three years ago, you were looking, I don't know what you were looking for. I think you did like a breed match quiz. Oh, that's so funny that you have a record of that. We keep really good notes. We contacted you and said you weren't interested then. It was January 5th, 2020. And by the way, the pictures of Alfie, I don't know if you noticed, the top two are new and the bottom two are not. Oh my gosh. Those are his baby pictures. He's so cute. He's really cute. And I think he's 15 weeks, it said. Yes. So it takes about two to three weeks to arrange for travel. Okay. Okay. All of this makes me feel, you know, good. In terms of next steps, is the next step literally for me to just hit the button to pay and then this whole process kicks off? Kind of, sort of. So let's say you would have done that without speaking to me on the phone first. It would have stayed pending until we actually had a conversation. We deny just as many people as we do breeders. That makes me feel good. Yeah. It would be really surprising. Well, maybe not. You're a New Yorker. It would be surprising. You know, the things that people say, you know, I could only say is that people are special. So we want to make sure that our families are choosing the right breed for their lifestyle. It's okay if you've never had a dog before. We want to make sure that obviously you're allowed to have a pet where you live, that you're going to have them spayed or neutered, whatever is appropriate. And, you know, these are family members. It's not a dog to just because you want to keep it in your pocket, which I say that because a lot of people say that. I want a dog that I can keep in my pocket. Oh, my God. Okay, so that's really clear. So I think I mean, I'm pretty convinced I just have to finalize a couple other things. I work remote most of the time, but I need to figure out a system when I'm not home. Right. Well, in Manhattan, there's a ton of services that you can have people come by and walk him or babysit. I'm originally from New York City. That was literally my job in my 20s. It was the best job I've ever had in my life. Yeah. Really. I bet. Yeah, it was awesome. So the delivery works. Our travel team is going to work out the logistics of what method of transport is going to be used. They're either driven or flown. Alfie is located in Ohio with his breeder. And, you know, within seven to ten days, you'll get the date and time. Do you have a car? I don't have a car. Do you have somebody with a car or Uber or something? Because I don't know yet where the delivery will be. Yeah, I can figure out a way to get to where she is. I mean, I could rent a car. I could take an Uber. That's no problem at all. That's one of the downfalls of Manhattan. I'm not too worried about the pickup. Yeah, you don't need a car. The delivery will be either at a major hub, an airport hub, or a public location. So that's going to be determined based off of logistics, what makes more sense for the puppy based on what airport he flies out of, weather plays a factor, availability, and his health exam. So our health team is going to coordinate that with the breeder, with the travel department. And our puppy manager team is the one that is coordinating it between everybody. So like I said, I'm your concierge. I'd go through the common sense screening questions with you. And then a puppy manager will reach out within about a week, seven to 10 days, and you'll get the tentative date. And I say tentative because Mother Nature sometimes has other ideas. This all sounds really, really great. Lisa, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. Of course. I, yeah, so I think I just need probably another day or two to figure out a couple of things on my end. Sure. Can I just reach back out to you with next steps? Yeah, and if he becomes unavailable, we'll find another one. Okay. That sounds great. But really, thank you so much for taking the time to chat. I really appreciate it. I am totally in love with this dog after seeing his photos. I know. The pleasure is definitely mine. And if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to contact me. I did text you. You could also reply to that text to the 561 number. Perfect. Okay? Perfect. All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Enjoy your day. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about the background and health of a specific puppy.

"Hi, my name is Amy. Hi, Amy. How are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm excellent. Thanks for asking. What can I help you out with? I was looking at a dog online and I wanted to get some more information about him and then someone sent me a text with the phone number, so I just called the phone number. Of course. And was it Freckles the Maltese? Yes. Awesome. I'm up here. Give me one moment. What can I answer for you about him? I wanted to, I know he's out of state, so I wondered what your, what the, how you guys do the travel. Yeah, absolutely. Great question. So let's just see here. Freckles age and whatnot. So looks like he's got a couple more days just to wait for him to be approved to travel. He needs to be, looks like the breeder is waiting nine weeks for him to go travel. So what would happen is after April 30th, he goes through a complete nose to tail health check. And after we review the paperwork from that and we say this puppy is perfect to go home, then we finalize travel plans. Now we would choose which upper is the safest for him. And that would either be air or ground transportation or a mix of the two. So if it ends up being air, it's with American Airlines. They're the only airline we trust with our animals because they have something called a pet safe flight. And there's an area on the plane that's pressurized temperature controlled and there's cameras on them the entire time, not with cargo or anything like that. Just like where you or I would sit just without all the crazy people on the planes these days. And then ground transportation is with our partner Premier Pet and they travel the puppies in sprinter vans with crates built in. And there's two people on those drives at all times. They make frequent stops checking on the puppies. If they have an accident, they clean them up. And in both cases, they have ice chips with them and food just because ice chips, because you can't put water in them and it would splash all around. So they've got water and food. Pick up would be at the airport if it did end up being air. And if it was ground, it would be pick up at a mutual location within 50 miles of your home. Okay. And then what if it was actually in... What if there was a one that was in state, in the state I live in? So then you could do meet up. Yeah. Pardon me? You could do the meet up option. So even if the puppy's not in state, if you did want to plan travel on your own to and from the breeder, that would just be the final health certificate. So that would be $287 and that's just all of the vaccines and everything from that final health check. Okay. Got it. Okay. So Freckles, I believe is out of... I think he's in Missouri. Let me double check for you. Yep. He's going to be coming from, it looks like Springfield, Missouri. Springfield. Okay. And then do you have any Maltese in South Florida? Oh, you're in Naples? Yes. We have a house in Naples. We have a house right behind Seed to Table. Oh, really? Yeah. We go, we go. I live over in Jacksonville Beach, but we have a house in Naples. Oh, nice. Bear with me. Most of our Florida breeders are, surprise, surprise, Chihuahuas and French Bulldogs. Let me double check. Okay. Looking like Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and let me just go to the next page. Yep. Just those three states for Maltese. Okay. And then... Wait a second. Hold on. I have two in Florida. Oh, nice. I have two in Florida, Aiden and Apollo. They're 16 weeks old. Their brother's dad was seven to eight pounds. Mom was nine to 10. Oh, Aiden and Apollo. I see them. Okay. Yeah. They're the ones, they're going to be hailing from, yep, Miami. Miami. Okay. So not too far from Naples, about an hour and a half. Yeah, that would be easy. That would be more of a pickup, but okay. I see them. Okay. All right. Well, and then the, I'm still looking, I'm back on Freckles. Freckles is, I've worked with that breeder before too. I've placed puppies from them before. I mean, not that Apollo and Aiden's breeder is bad. They work with us, so I know that they're good anyway. But Freckles' breeder is amazing. Their puppy's great. So the, it's price is $36.49 online. And then what's the fee for everything else if he were to fly here? So it would be $711 flat rate for the pickup near home travel option. So any puppy on our site, no matter where they're coming from or going would be the 711. Aiden and Apollo, if you did that meetup, would just be the 287. Okay. So, so the total for Freckles would be $36.49. $36.49 plus 711, that would be before taxes because unfortunately we have no taxes. So it would be before taxes, $43.60. And then what are the taxes? What is your zip code? 34102. That would be 7%. It looks like $317.73. So total with everything. I can get you a discount too. Bear with me. I can get you some free stuff in there. Let me just give you the total cost for Freckles. So it would be, I'm just adding on your free AKC because then it's before taxes. So just give me a moment here. Sorry for the wait. There we go. So it would be around $4,600. $4,600. Okay. Yeah. Oh man. Okay. Have you had multi-suffies before? I do. I have a nine-year-old now and we just lost our 12-year-old a couple months ago. And then I lost another one. I normally have either two or three. They're just family pets. We don't breed. We just have a family. So super expensive. So okay. Yeah. Apollo and Aiden, they're, let me just pull them back up here. I'd like a smaller one. They're a little bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Freckles is going to definitely be, I mean, both parents, five to six pounds. He's more than likely going to be five to six pounds. Right. But the smaller they are too, that's also why they're a little bit more expensive too because the smaller they are and the more hypoallergenic they are, prices go up. Yeah. Yeah. I just haven't paid that much for them. None of mine and mine are four pounds. So, okay. All of our dogs do come with a 10-year health commitment as well, just because of all of the checks we've done with our breeders and the genetic tests we've done on the parents and stuff. We know you're going to have that healthy puppy. So we do have that in place. That is kind of why our prices are more expensive than say, like Petland or any of those other guys. So we definitely are the cheapest around, but in the long run, if you really think about it, it saves you money from going to the vet, from getting a puppy from a puppy mill or a puppy store or something like that. Right. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to speak to my husband and then I will. So he travels on the plane. He's not in, he's with people. No, he's not in cargo. He's not in cargo. So American Airlines, they have only a certain amount of their planes have this area. Not all of their planes do, usually the bigger ones. Other airlines have the same area on there, but they use it to ship different things that they make more money with. So American Airlines is the only one that we do it. Yeah. It's not cargo. It's not with a luggage or anything like that. It's specifically made for animals. And they send them in a crate. Yeah. So if it's airport pickup, the puppies come with a crate. If it does end up being ground transportation, the crates are built into the Sprinter van. So if it's ground transport, no crate, air transport, yeah, crate. Okay. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. And then you gave me all the discounts that I could get at $4,600. I did. Yeah. So I gave you, so we've got the biggest discount I could get you in there was you have to get a pup pack, which is like a coming home kit with everything in there and the AKC Reunite enrollment, which works with all microchips. Typically those together are around $250. And then I got you a discount for $300. So it takes, it kind of takes $50 off. Okay. Let me just see. I don't think this breeder does it. No. So the prices are set by the breeders too. So this breeder does not offer any additional discounts, unfortunately. But I can place Freckles on just a two hour reservation. Just while you think about it. Okay. Just to give you some time so he's not scooped up just while you're making your decision. Right. Okay. And is this your direct line? So if you call in, you should be directed to me. My name's Kristen. If you don't get me for some reason, you can just ask for me. I did also just send you over some parent photos for Freckles. So all of my direct contact information will be in there as well. Okay. Very good. Yeah. All right. Perfect. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Of course, Amy. And if you have any other questions, just feel free to either email me, give me a call back. But if I don't hear from you by the time his reservation comes off, I'll just give you a call, follow up with you. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. You're welcome. Amy. Bye bye. Bye bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about travel options for a specific puppy and also asked about other available puppies in their area.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Kristen, whom I have the pleasure of speaking with. Hi, Kristen. This is Peggy Wells. Hi, Peggy. How are you doing today? Oh, pretty good. I have a couple of questions for you. Of course. My daughter, Erin Joyce, I had to think of her last name, adopted a Havanese puppy from you all about a year and a couple months ago. We renamed him Cooper, Joyce, who's black and white Havanese, just as cute as can be. He doesn't stop biting when he's playing. He barks. If he sees a leaf drop from a tree, he's barking. Oh, no. They sent him to a trainer. I just don't know what else that can be done. It didn't help him. I think the trainer was anxious to give him back. I don't really know what to do. Oh, no. What breed is... Wait. What was your daughter's last name? Joyce, J-O-Y-C-E, Erin and Kevin Joyce. Erin and Kevin Joyce. All right. Kevin and Erin Joyce, I guess. Let's see here. I don't... And you flew him in on a jet, I think. I don't have... Do you have her phone number? What's her phone number? Yes. 310-776-8000. 310-776-8000. 0750. 0750. Okay. Ah, here she is. Javonese. Okay. I was going to say, I don't see her. All right. Javonese. Let's see here. Oh, Miles. Yeah, Miles. Isn't he cute? Oh, he's so cute. And he is adorable. He's such a good boy. So... And what did the trainer do? Well, I didn't talk to the trainer or anything. Erin talked to him. Or, you know, they sent him for a week away. Oh, he went away to like a... Okay. So he went to boot camp. Yeah, it was... Yeah, boot camp. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know if they used e-callers or not? E-callers? What's that? Yeah. Like electrical callers? Oh, electrical callers. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I bought one at Hammock for Slimmer. I bought one. But Erin said it didn't work. It didn't work. Okay. That's the next step I was going to recommend. Because... Hmm. Interesting. And he's just... And he's only... He's not too old. Looks like about a year ago he came home. So... Just seeing how this is going. Okay. So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So. So... So... nervous he's he's defending he's defending everybody he's protective that's what it is protective okay but although he you know bites and you know when we're sometimes he'll get mad let's see what do we do what do I do I don't try to tease him you know he's not being teased he just what he want what he wants what he wants and he's telling you what he wants he is the boss of the family that's it yep how is he how is he around children how is he around dog other dogs well he doesn't get out that much again I don't I don't see him you know all the time but no I do see him every day probably but not to get him out with the other dogs they don't have a dog park here I would recommend I would recommend maybe bringing him around other dogs other dogs yeah because I mean if they really could we just we have a puppy spot puppy as well and she's an excellent dog but she just pulled a little bit on the leash and and not a little bit she pulled a lot on the leash so and she's a 50 pound Bernadine so it's quite hard after a while you know so we did look into something like your daughter did like sending her away to like a little bit of a boot camp and they use the e-collars they were very nice we actually were very interested in doing that but socialization with other dogs just so he can kind of see how other dogs act as well that I think would help a lot also and just just as long as he's not too aggressive like is it isn't a mean bark or is it just like that hey I'm here to get away or is it like a really mean mean bark I really know I don't it's just you know get away I'm here this is my place I'm here I don't think to them you know he'll continue barking at them but yeah but you know he looks outside and keep people walking by or dogs walking by and barking so I don't know sounds like he might just be a little bit more curious like you know he wants you to know that he's there too and that he's aware of his surroundings I would suggest maybe bringing him around some other dogs maybe he just needs to see how other dogs act in similar situations start small though since he is a small breed he's a small how many how much does he weigh right now do you think I would think maybe nine I don't I really know I would suggest starting small maybe finding like a small dog park or like a dog run or something like that in the area dog bar they have those now so definitely recommend checking that out and seeing if you can just socialize with some other dogs or maybe doggy daycare or something like that just see if introducing him to some other dogs would help him oh yeah that's interesting a doggy daycare yeah we did we when we first got Kolei our Bernadette she was going to doggy day not not because we needed it because we both work from home so we were around but just socializing her with other dogs is really important so we would send her for the first couple of months once a week just a doggy daycare just to get out some zoomies just get out some energy and just see how other dogs act oh that's that's a good idea I'm sure they miss one here in California somewhere oh they have and dog bars too like I said start out small just introduce him to dogs in the smaller setting like go to they have dog bars everywhere these days so just go to your maps go to Google Maps type in like a dog bar or something like that they have different areas sometimes and for those like one for smaller dogs and then one for the larger breed dogs bring him into the smaller side have me how he is with other dogs keep a close eye on him make sure you're following him around and whatnot just in case you never know and then maybe try to find like a doggy daycare I tell your daughter to reach out to some friends see if they recommend anything in the area as well okay that's a good idea too yeah okay all right well I'm gonna pull out the dog the dog collar that thing that I have try the collar he called it he called it yeah you know what else you do there's this guy on YouTube his name is Zach George Z a K and then George felt normally he has a lot of great videos as well for dog training I recommend him oh yeah he's really helpful Zach George okay good I'll try to all righty well I'll let you know you know the your excellent suggestions and yeah hopefully it will if we're all fingers crossed yeah hopefully if you and if you have any other questions or if Aaron has any questions my name's Kristen just call us call us back ask for me I've been here for a while too I'd be happy to help okay oh thanks a lot Chris I appreciate it you're

"Good morning, this is from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. We were looking, my wife and I were looking at your website. And we looked at it a while back, a few days ago. And we live in Alabama. And we were trying to find Doberman puppies. Okay. Maybe a female is what we're trying to find. All righty. Do you have any breeder that's named Lovely Pinscher or Lovely Doberman or something like that? We saw that ad on Puppy Spot. For Lovely? Lovely Dobermans or something like that. I don't know. I'm not sure. We work with private breeders, if you saw them somewhere else, then I don't know who they are. We don't put our breeders' names on the website. Oh, okay. So, my wife claims that she saw it on Puppy Spot. With the name of the breeder? Well, it was the website of the breeder. I don't remember the breeder's name. No, we don't. At the moment, I have one, two... Where are we, man? I have four Dobermans right now. Females. None of them are in Alabama. Oh, okay. They actually contacted us about four days ago. You spoke to us. Okay. You said you were looking at Grayson, who's no longer available. Right. We were looking at one called Lily. Lily? I don't have a Lily on our site. You were looking on our website. Is your wife named Candy? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. You were looking at a puppy named Grayson, and you mentioned that the prices are too high. Right. Right. Okay. That's what we were wondering, because this breeder, she claimed she was looking at your puppy spot and... I know. And... Again, we don't list the breeder's names on our website. Okay. Okay. We're our own website. Okay. Maybe we can just keep trying to research to see if we can find it, because we have a list... Why do you want that specific breeder? Just because I saw it. Just because it was in Alabama and what she saw. She liked the puppy that she saw. Okay. I mean, I have some great Dobermans, but we travel them to you. Female puppy? You do? Yeah. Female puppy, black and yellow with their ears dark? Let me see if her ears are done. I think her ears are done already. So, I'd have to double check if her ears are done, because we don't post them on our site if they are wrapped. We would have like an older picture. I have a girl named Aspen. She's 14 weeks old. She's 3,700 before tax and travel. And then I have others that are going to be already, you know, with the pictures of them docked, 23 weeks old. I have one 17 weeks old. They're $51.99. Okay. Okay. You say that that includes the delivery? No, without delivery. Oh, okay. Okay. Delivery is $711, but that covers their health certificates and 10 years against congenital and hereditary conditions. And they'll have all their age-appropriate vaccinations. Okay. Will they be AKC registered? Are you looking to breed them? No, no. No, but we want to make sure. Yeah, they're registered. They're companion registrations, meaning they're not for breeding purposes, but, yes, they're AKC registered. Oh, okay. Okay. That's what we were trying to look at and try to find. Yeah. I wish I could find that website that she was on there because they had some pretty dogs, too. I have some gorgeous puppies. I have five. One of the five are $36.99. The rest are higher. Right, right. Like Rosie is gorgeous. Rosie is 23 weeks old. She's a little less. She's $51.99. She's in Louisiana. Oh, really? She's pretty. Yeah, I see her. You see Rosie? Yes, ma'am. Champion bloodlines. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yes, champion bloodlines. Yes, ma'am. They all are. Aspen is the one that's the 36. Right. Gorgeous, gorgeous parents. Okay, I see her now. Champion bloodlines. Okay. Yeah, I see the ears are not done. I think they are. Do you mind holding a moment? Sure. Okay. ♪♪ Hello. Yes, ma'am. Okay, sorry about that. I think Aspen's ears are already done, but we wouldn't post them if they're still being wrapped. Oh, okay, okay, okay. I'm checking to see if I can find out. Price-wise, does this match what you're looking for? Something like that, yes, ma'am. Yeah. Let me see if it says anything in the notes about Aspen. The only reason I think her ears are done already is because the pictures weren't updated yet. Yes, ma'am. Because I know that her brother's ears are done already. Oh, okay. And same age? Yeah, brothers. So Aspen, there were 14 puppies in that litter. Oh, your kids. Wow. I know. Isn't that amazing? Wow. Yes, ma'am. Kind of crazy. So Aspen's not local. Like Louisiana, you can go pick up if you wanted to. That's where she is, in Louisiana? No, Aspen's in California. Oh, that's a little too far away. Yeah, no, but we deliver. Unless you want to go to Louisiana, Ivy's in Louisiana and Rosie. Okay, are they sisters? Yeah, they're 23 weeks old already, about five months. Okay. They're pretty. They're beautiful, yeah. You've had Dobermans before? Oh, yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. We've had several Dobermans. Yes, ma'am. Gorgeous. I mean, Ivy's already like 55 pounds. Oh, wow. She's a big girl. And then her sister, let's see, her sister, Rosie. Yep, the same weight. Okay, okay. And they're ready, the tails, of course, are docked. They're going to be up to date on all their vaccinations. They already had all their puppy vaccines. They started them on HeartGuard already. HeartGuard, good. Yeah, yeah. Well, at this stage, they have to. Parents, beautiful. They've been breeding Dobermans for over 30 years. Oh, okay. Moms are retired at five. They're socialized with their children. Oh. Yeah, all of them would be socialized. Right. And typically the breeders we have for Dobermans only breed Dobermans. Right, right. Yes, ma'am. And I do have photos of the parents if you wanted to see them. I mean, Aspen's priced a lot lower, but she's further away. Right. Gorgeous dog, Aspen. Yes, ma'am, a lot further away. Yeah, I mean, price-wise it's not that much different because if you picked up, it's $287 to pick up in Louisiana, for example. The $287 is going to cover all the vaccinations and the health checks in 10 years against the congenital and hereditary conditions. And if we deliver, it's $711. So it's like a $400 difference. But she's also priced a lot lower, Aspen, than Rosie and Ivy. Right. There's no wrong choice, honestly. They're all great-looking dogs, great-looking parents, fantastic breeders. You have to decide if you wanted a five-month-old puppy. Right. I do not know the puppy name, really. What's that? She was one, if you heard, this, of course, I think it was on a different site, but it, her dog was named Lily. And she was very beautiful. She was pretty. What was that? I thought she was in Alabama. That's what I thought. Oh, I don't know. I only know the puppy's on my own site. Do you remember what they were asking for her? No, ma'am. No, ma'am, I don't. I mean, it was a lot less than I remember. You've got to also be careful if you see prices that are extremely low. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. There's a lot of scammers out there. We've been in business for about 17 years. Yes. We ran into one of my first Dobermans, he wound up getting hereditary pancreas disease and he didn't live long. Yeah. I mean, they can be prone to, you know, different things. Usually it's heart disease. Yes, yes. But listen, every dog has their own kryptonite, so to speak. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Let us think about it because we're interested in getting a Doberman. We're not trying to find a fly-by-night deal either. Right, right. Now I get it. Listen, we've been doing this for a very long time. The breeders that we work with are screened already and vetted. These are the top 10% of the breeders in the country. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And if you'd like Rosie or Ivy, you can pick them up in a week. You're not far from Louisiana, right? No, ma'am. We're in Alabama, yes, ma'am. Yeah. So you would just go. We'd pick a day next week. They'd have a full health evaluation before you pick her up. And if there's anything on that exam, we'd have to notify you in advance before you get her. Right. Okay. But they're both beautiful dogs. Yes, they are. All three of them are beautiful. Yes, they're all beautiful. Let's think about this and we'll get back with you because we're still looking at your site all the time. That's all right. Listen, like I said, these are available now. There's two others, but they're priced a lot higher, 63, I think. Right. Once you click on the pictures, you can see the prices. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. So as long as you call back from Candy's number, the call will come to me. Okay? My name is Lisa. Lisa, yes, ma'am. Thank you very much. All right. Have a good day. Ma'am, you too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about Doberman puppies and a specific breeder they saw on Puppy Spot website.

"Hello. Hey, it's Angel from Peppy Spot. How are you doing this morning? Good. How are you? Great. Thank you for asking. So I was just conversing quite about Sonny and I was just wondering what questions you might have about him. Well, we're still looking at the moment, but we know that we want it to be a male dog and a puppy. All right. I see you said you're looking for something that'll be gentle and all. I mean, I'm not sure how familiar you are with labs, but they can, especially chocolate ones, they're known to never grow up. So they're like forever puppy. So they can tend to be quite wild. Even the calm ones can still tend to be quite on the wild side a little bit. Yeah, I had one and she was really good, but she was hyper all the time. Yeah. And that tends to be especially chocolate lab are ones that tend to stay like yellow and the black can come down some, but the chocolate tend to stay like forever puppies is what I always say. Yeah. The only reason I was really looking at a lot of because they can do like self-train. Are they really good about all of that? So it just totally depends on how much you work with them because they are a little bit sometimes. And they actually are not one of the easier breeds to train. OK, well, maybe I just got a really good one. The one I had, she only used the bathroom in the house one time. And that was the first night that we brought her home. And other than that, she was pretty good. But she always wanted to play. Yeah. I trained like that that you can get any dog to never use the bathroom in the house. Honestly, it's just it just depends on the dog because even you could train the dog with whole life and do great. And then it gets older and then it starts to reverse. So, you know, that that aspect is totally not just based on that, because I was a vet for five years and there's many labs I saw that were not the same. Yeah. So. So what would you recommend? We are one a larger breed dog, but one that's going to be more on the calm side. So I would definitely take a look at the golden retrievers more so than the lab. They are a lot calmer. They are still very obedient and very wanting to please. But they're a lot calmer than what the labs are. And so but they have, you know, they have similar dispositions, but it's still getting going and getting outside. They just calm down a lot easier than what the labs tend to do. Yeah. What other breeds would you say? So I'm going to say probably not German Shepherd because they can be a little bit high strung to. Rob Wilders are actually surprisingly really calm and they are really good with kids and stuff. They can be protective of the kids sometimes, but that's kind of what we want to. Yeah. So, I mean, that's not always a bad thing. And but Rob Wilders tend to, especially because how their faces are structured, they tend to wear out kind of easy. But there are honestly like some people are scared of them, but they're big babies. Like every Rob Wilder I've met has been fantastic. And they are really good family dogs, too. Yeah, we were looking right before you called. We were looking at one named Peppy, but we don't want a female. Sadly, we want a male. OK, so we should have some more Rob Wilders. Let me see. I know they can go kind of quickly on our site. And they are pretty big. Yeah, we do have one, two, three, four, five males on there, too, if you do want to go and check them out. OK. And what would you have to say about King Corsos? Because my boyfriend is like really stuck on that on that breed. They're similar to Rob Wilders. They can be a little bit more stubborn, but they are very similar to how the Rob Wilders and stuff are. And they're they're good family dogs, too. And they get really big. So just be prepared for that. That's why he wants one, I think. They get super big. I'm all about the big dogs. My pit bull is 104 pounds. So I totally, totally understand. It's like, you know, you can actually be rough and tough with them, but then there's still love bugs. And that's another good breed. And a lot of people I work with do end up getting them as family dogs. OK. Where are you guys located? Because I didn't know. I was looking at the site, but we're all the way in Newton, North Carolina. OK, so it just depends on the breed or the puppy, because we have individual breeders. Only certain ones have been qualified to work with us. So it looks like our Rob Wilders will either be, which we do have travel available if you don't want to go to the same state as a breeder and get the puppy. But we do have the Rob Wilders in Indiana and Missouri. And then our King Corsos are in. Oh, it's like our King Corsos are in Pennsylvania and Indiana. But you said you do have travel available to like bring them to us. Yes, ma'am. So what it is, that travel team is coordinated and they bring the baby to within 100 miles or less of where you're located for a public meet up. OK. All right. And what are your like finance options? I know you said that you had those on there. I just didn't know how it worked with you guys. Yes, ma'am. So you can either do the take me home on the website itself and then you can apply for PayPal, which is six months interest free if you get approved or a company that a lot more people go with. They just have higher approval amounts and more people do get approved. They're called Paris Finance. So I'm sending you their name over text message. And for them, you would just go to their website and apply. I would say apply for about a thousand more than the puppies price to make sure you have enough to cover the tax and travel. And then if you give them a phone call right afterwards, actually expedite it. So you'll know in about 20 to 30 minutes your full approval amount. And then if you get enough to cover everything, there's only ninety nine dollars you started with. Otherwise, it's the difference between what you were approved for and what's owed. Right. What was it about the nine dollars that you were saying? If you get approved for the full amount to cover the puppy, the tax and travel is only ninety nine dollars to get started. And if you don't get approved for the full amount, it's the difference. OK, and then what would you say, like the monthly payments would be or is it monthly payments or. Totally depends. So they won't give you your terms until after we do to do the deposit and all. But what it is, is that because they'll do it based on how much is left. And so they'll let you know what it's going to be, because sometimes they offer like 90 days interest free. Sometimes they go and do the monthly. They sometimes they do biweekly. It just totally depends what they do. Usually have different options. But they will go and do that contract with you after we do the deposit and say that you don't like the terms. You can nullify the contract. We'll refund your money. You don't have to go through with it. But if you do like it, then you would just sign the contract. And then we just continue the process as normal. If they you work to finance the puppy. OK. All right. So I would just do it all through the Web site. Yes, ma'am. Do that when I sent you and then give them a phone call right afterwards. All right. Thank you so much. Yes, ma'am. And if you think of any more questions, make sure to reach out. Let me know. All right. I will. All right. You have a great day. You too. Bye bye.","{'Summary': 'The customer is looking for a male puppy that is calm and gentle.

"Today we're calling Puppy Spot. This is Alan speaking. How may I help you? Yeah, actually, good morning. Actually, I'm looking for puppies, poodles, toy poodles. I'm living in New Jersey. Actually, I like one, one of the puppies. Cody. C-O-D-Y. C is in cat, orange, doll, yellow. C-O-D-Y. Okay, give me one second. Is there a number next to the dog? Number is not there. Name is Cody. Nine people are interested in this puppy. Cody, eight weeks old? Yes, yes. C-O-D-Y? Yeah, C-O-D-Y. Okay. Alrighty. So, eight weeks. You did reach out to us like two weeks ago. So, are you familiar with the process? Yes, yes. Okay. So, what happened two weeks ago? I am looking on all the sites. I am looking for best prices. So, I decided to go for this reasonable price. Is there any low price? Is there any apricot color and poodle? I'm looking for poodle only, apricot color. Well, let's see. I mean, what kind of pricing are you looking at? What's the minimum price, apricot color, basic price? Let's see. My minimum price on a poodle is $1,400. Apricot color. It's a toy, female. I want a male one. You want a male? Yes. So, my minimum male in apricot is going to be, I have a 16-week-old for $1,849. And then I have a 16-week-old for $2,499. What is the name for that? Buster. Buster? Yes. B-U-S-T-E-R. It's a poodle only, right? Yes. It's under a miniature poodle. I can send you a picture. Give me one second. I just sent to your email. One second. No, I didn't get any mail. It's under your promotions for Gmail. If not, hold on a second. I'll text it to you in a second. Actually, where is it located in the main branch? The puppy is coming from Ohio. Is there any delivery charges available? What is that? Is it free charges or do I need to pay for delivery? No, you have to pay. It's $711. Or you can go out to Ohio and pick up the dog. We charge $287. You don't have any near puppies, New Jersey, New York, or other areas? I don't have any breeders that I'm working with, no. Closest to where you are is going to be Ohio, pretty much. What you can do is go on to akc.org and then type in poodles local to you. You might come across some breeders there. But we're just not working with any breeders in the tri-state area or New England area. Okay. Actually, it's almost a little price, right? What I have to search, where is it? The size of this dog? Okay. It'll be about 10 to 12 pounds, full grown. Did you see the picture yet or no? No, I didn't get the picture. Okay. I'm texting you the picture of the dog. That's the one that's $1,849. I got, oh, nice. So you would have the price of the dog. You would have the travel if you want us to deliver. And then you would have your tax in New Jersey. I got one more mail. One puppy is coming from Florida. I don't know that name. I will. One second. S-A-R-A-H. S-A-R-A-H. I don't have any breeders in Florida. For poodle? Yeah, poodle. I got a patient giving you a call shortly. I'm coming from a Florida number, new phone. You're in New Jersey or Florida? New Jersey. Okay. So what does Florida have to do? I'm not understanding. One puppy is there in Florida. I got a message from your site, one of your sites. No, we're going to show up in everything, every state, every city. It doesn't mean that the dog is there. It's just Google doing. I don't have any poodle breeders in Florida. I mean, I'm in Florida, but I don't have any poodle breeders in Florida. Okay. See, for small puppies, which one is the doodle is the best or poodle? Both are the same, doodle and poodle? Well, you can get a very small poodle, or if you want a golden doodle, I have some small golden doodles. What is the difference between a poodle and a doodle? What is the difference? The difference is that the golden doodles are bred with golden retrievers and a poodle combination. A poodle is strictly poodles. A lot of people like the golden retriever look, but they can't handle the dander and the hair. So when you breed with a poodle, then it becomes better. Okay. See, poodle, it will come with more hair. It will fall more hair. Poodle? A poodle? No. No. I mean, it's got this normal hair. You're going to have to groom. You're going to have to do a grooming. Okay. When it overgrows, but that's something. Okay, fine. Okay. Thank you so much for the information. Okay. I will get back to you. Thank you. Okay.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about purchasing a specific puppy and also asked about pricing and availability of other puppies.

"Then we're going bumpy spot this is Alan speaking I may help you. Hey Alan this is Sherry Horn how are you? How are you Sherry? I'm good sorry my phone just automatically sends things to spam. That's fine you know yeah well we come in as spam we come in different sometimes it all depends on the carrier. Yeah yeah. Okay let me pull up so I was just reaching out to to answer questions that you might have also explain how the process works with our company. How did you guys how did you hear about us? Well I actually I went on Google and I was looking up you know Bernice Mountain Dogs we've always talked about wanting to get one and I just recently had to have one of my St. Bernard's put down at a young age and you know and I was like I really really really want a Bernice and my husband was like fine look it up. That's pretty much how I came across you. That's fine yeah that tells us our Google's working. Yeah so anyway even though I am in I don't know I guess you might tell I don't know if it tells you where I'm calling from so but we are a network of breeders we screen the background check we have a hundred percent no puppy mill guarantee for you we have been in business over 17 years a plus rated on the Better Business Bureau. We did start our business in Hollywood Florida so and I'm I'm calling from home it's in Boynton Beach so they closed the office. I'm in Jacksonville. Yeah so so basically what happens is I mean the dogs are coming from breeders so they we set up the transportation we set up everything we handle all the paperwork we handle the transaction of the funds and everything like that so the dogs come to you up to date on all vaccinations which you'll get a copy of they come with the state issued health certificate their vet check before they leave the breeders location you get a copy of that and our company gives you a 10-year health commitment covers any type of hereditary or congenital issues that are considered life-threatening to the dog. Now Kate is just a website name so she is coming from Indiana. Okay. I'm a litter of eight weighs about eight to nine pounds you're gonna get a sample of food called eucanuba just to get you started. She's been in car rides she's been stimulated for loud noises socialized with children socialized with other dogs other animals she is gonna be microchipped for you and the breeder is potty training outside on grass. Okay. Let's see here okay breeders been breeding over 10 years and they have been always like to say they've been with us since 2017. Okay. I'm strictly Bernie's Mountain Dogs. So you did the check out I'm not sure so basically the 7-11 is covered covers a couple of things it covers the travel and then covers the vet check and health certificate also in there that is called pickup near home what that entails is that we would transport the puppy down to a central location within an hour to two hour radius around your home. Okay. It could be Orlando I'm not really sure how far Jacksonville and Orlando is. It's a couple hours. Okay because we do use Orlando a lot but it just depends on how many dogs are coming into the area and that's how they set it up. It does take approximately two to three weeks to do that. Okay. To get everything set up she gets a final vet check when she's purchased it that we give the breeders about five days to handle that. Now we take major credit cards PayPal debit those are all secured sites for you we do require a full payment once you make your decision to move forward. I do about a 15-minute screening talk about the terms and conditions and and other things and then I email you that email that to you with the invoice to your email and then you just make the payment online from there. But you did your website did say that you have financing options available. Yes. Okay. I'm going to go over that with you too. Not a problem. Okay I'm sorry. There is another option also that you can go pick the dog up if you're into driving up to Orlando, Indiana but that's an option for you too. That saves you money also. Give me one second. Okay with the financing let's go back we have a couple options. One is PayPal credit 0% interest for six months that's the best one but of course your credit has to be good and then they do you know do a credit check. They're the fastest one out of the two. The other that's on our website is called Terrace Financing. They are actually an umbrella for three other companies. So you would fill out one one application and depending on your credit score that will determine which company would work with you. Minimum you have to have a 675 credit score and the last one doesn't even look at your credit score but of course that's going to be the highest interest rate for you. Right. If you get approved for the full amount of the financing and that's with either one well with Terrace then we just require a $99 down payment that gets deducted off your total and then the balance gets sent over to the finance company. They create the contract they email it back to you for your ASIC and that's how that works. If one does not cover the full amount then of course the balance would have to be made by a major credit card. Right. So I just sent you Terrace. Did you want me to send you the PayPal? Yes send me both. I'll be honest with you we've never like paid this amount of money for an animal. We normally do rescue but I'm just I really want. Yeah I'm looking for a certain breed. So not a problem. Yeah I mean look everybody I talked to is the same. It's not like we're always we get a lot of repeat customers but most of our customers are new so I always hear about it. It's first time buying online, first time you know. Which is nerve-wracking obviously. Of course yeah. Yeah it's not like a piece of furniture that you're purchasing it. Right. But it's unfortunate we don't do that so and you know we understand that but we've been in business over 17 years. So yeah. It's been working for us and you know we work with you. It's not like you know we stay with you even during. You could always reach out to us too you know while you have the puppy. Okay okay. Well I mean I feel very comfortable about it. I mean we just like I said I we just had to have our St. Bernard one of our St. Bernard's sit down on last Monday and I was like I was and she was only five. She had bone cancer and and I always get siblings and so my husband when I told him how much you know Kate is he's like you're not getting a brother and a sister just so you know. I had Lady and Tramp when Lady's the one who had to be put down and then I have Anna and Olaf which if we do get approved for the financing for Kate her name's going to be Bella. So all right. Well look I have two dogs. I find we find it really worthwhile doing that. You know we love our dogs. We do. We just you know we I have four St. Bernard's and I have a lab and three of my dogs are rescues and I normally go to rescue but I was just like I really really want a Bernice. Well that's the thing when you want a specific breed you're not going to really find it in the rescue. It's a rarity. Exactly. Yeah yeah it is a very rare thing so but all right well I appreciate your time and I'll go ahead and you know we'll we'll fill out the financing and if we get approved great if not then you know it is what it is. So I'll keep an eye out because I can check the dashboard on that too. So okay that sounds great. Thank you so much. My pleasure. All right take care. You too. Bye bye.","{'Summary': 'Sherry called to inquire about the process of purchasing a Bernese Mountain Dog from the company.

"Hi, it's Lisa from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? Yes, this is Lou Anne Fratt. I spoke with you yesterday about Tiffy and Valentine. I spoke to your daughter-in-law also yesterday. Oh, yes. We're all very excited about getting a dog. Anyway, so I'm interested in Tiffy or Valentine. Okay. So, Mittens, you changed your mind. What? You changed your mind about Mittens. Yeah. Okay. Partly because I couldn't see all her coloring. On Tiffy, I think both she... All the dogs are adorable. On Tiffy, I like her, but it looks like, you know, the coloring around her eyes is different on one side than the other, but, you know, I guess that's the way it is. Yeah. Markings are markings. And you definitely don't want a girl, a boy. No. Okay. And Tiffy is, let me see, she's little too. Yeah. Which is nice. She's smaller than Valentine. Right. Did you get the date when you're coming back? Yes. We're coming back the 17th of May. The 17th of May. So, I have to make sure that we have a route available and that the breeder will hold the puppy until after that date. Yeah. Okay. Now, if I can find out that information, are you interested in moving forward today? Yes. All righty. Let me see. It's the cost of the transportation that's bothering me also, as I told you. I'm going to see if I have the $711 package. Yeah. Also, I found some place where I could get a $300 discount. Are you familiar? Yeah. You got an email about that? Yeah. Perfect. I can answer that. I don't know if it was an email or what. Yeah. No worries. I can add that for you. Just give me a moment. I'm finding out about the travel for you, okay? Yep. Last night, the travel team was gone, so I had nobody to ask. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. We bothered you late at night. Not at all. Not at all. No bother. Okay. I'm just waiting on an answer, okay? No problem. Bear with me. She's very cute. You know, Mittens is really cute. I wish I could have seen her coloring on her front and back. So, Mittens, there's a video of her, as I mentioned. You can see it in the video. Yeah. She's mostly white. She's adorable. Yeah. You didn't see her video? Oh, yes. I've got her on right now. But I'm still towards Valentine and Tiffy. Right. So Tiffy is more likely that they'll be able to hold her a little bit longer because the other two are older? Yeah. They may not want to hold her? Right. I understand that. Okay. So... I'm excited to go to Hawaii, but I wish I wasn't and I could get her right now. Aw. Okay, so I do have options to travel the puppy by ground transportation. Do you remember the discount that you got? What the code was for it? Oh, no. I have no idea. I can't remember. Okay. All right. Let's see. Bear with me. Okay. So... I'm excited to go to Hawaii. Okay. So before the discount, I have to get a code to put in for you. It's 4241.32. Wait. It's what now? Before the discount. $4241.32. That includes tax, travel, health certificates, activation of a microchip for life, a starter kit, everything you need gets sent to you to help acclimate her to the home, you know, with bed, blanket, bowls, leash, toys. There's 14 items in there. And I just have to... Is that the disc, with the discount also? Without the discount. So... That's without? Mm-hmm. And it's going to adjust your taxes, too. Here, let me tell you what the discount... Since you don't have the code, I have to put one in. And this is for Tiffy, which I think will be more manageable as far as size and availability, because she's younger. She's not ready yet until after the 4th, anyway. Yeah. I'm just waiting for the code. Sometimes the breeder asks for an extra fee to hold the puppy, but we're going to find out. Okay. Is that ground transportation or what? Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is. it is. The drivers are fabulous by the way. They're getting very well cared for on their journey. Good. Okay so with the discount it came to three thousand nine hundred and ten dollars and fifty seven cents. Okay. Okay your taxes are high. Your taxes are terrible. Ten point ten and a quarter percent. Good. So all I'm doing is waiting for the the okay on the date. I don't think it's going to be a big deal. I do have her, especially since she's younger, I do have her on a reserve for you at the moment. Okay. And your billing address is 260 LaSalle Avenue? Yes. Piedmont. I have here Oakland. No it's Piedmont. They, with the zip, the zip is the same for part of Oakland. I live in Piedmont. P-I-E-D-M-O-N-T, California. All right. You know in worst case scenario would Tori pick up the puppy if she had to? When? If if the breeder says no. If it's a few days. I don't think so. I don't I don't know but I don't think so. Okay. She she is in real shape. Okay. I mean you'll get the travel date within seven to ten days from moving forward. You'll get an email about the travel. Yeah. You'll know you'll know it in advance. So I don't know what? You'll know the travel date in advance. They'll give you like um you know the week of they'll tell you when the puppy's coming since it's around transportation it can change a little bit you know by the day but the puppy manager team is going to be in touch with you to make sure that they you know update you on exactly the date and then you know they'll drop off at a public location so to be determined by them. So a public a public location? Correct. Correct. Well then I would assume would be close by. Yeah yeah yeah. You're not in like a remote area. You're you know you're fairly close to everything. Yeah. Let me um I'm just waiting on the date on the okay for the travel. Yeah. And if you'd like in the meantime I can email you the link so you can look at it for the payment. You could email me what? The invoice. Oh yeah. Do I need to put a deposit or what? It's a full payment if you decide you wanted to move forward with her. Yeah okay. The puppy's gonna have a full health exam prior to travel and if anything is on that exam even if it's minor our health team is going to reach out to you. Now considering you're going to be in Hawaii if they can't reach you by phone they're going to email you as well. Yeah okay well I'll be available in Hawaii. Right and I also have... Oh I might give you my what? I also have Tori's phone number. Yeah yeah. Worst case scenario they can't reach you they'll try her. You have a number at 610-619? I have no I have 650-619-3621. Tell me what it is again. This is Tori's number 650-619-3621. Did you say 510? 650-619-3621. Yes that's it. Yes I'm sorry. I was thinking of something else. And your number is the one we're talking on right now right? Yes my landline. Okay what's your cell phone? I'll give it to you but I don't use it that much. My cell phone is 510-882-9558. I prefer my landline. I have an answering machine. Of course when I'm in Hawaii I could be contacted by cell phone. Right right. But the best would be to contact Tori. Okay so I have her email as well so I'm going to call you back as soon as I get a response about the date. I already sent the notification. Again I don't think it's going to be a problem but I just have to verify and see if they're going to charge a fee. Okay then let me ask you one more question. Is Valentine the prices would be pretty much the same? Yeah she's $200. Less. Yeah. A long shot if they'll hold her because she's already 14 weeks and she's a lot bigger. Yeah no. You know how much it doesn't give her weight. It gives her father and mother. Right so now. 10, 12 to 14. As of a week ago she's between four and four and a half pounds. Yeah okay. Okay so I'll just wait to hear from you. Yeah I'll call you back. I'll be calling from a 954 number as soon as I get an answer. It shouldn't take too long and I have Tiffy on a reserve for you. No one else can get her. Yeah you're going to call me on my landline. Yes ma'am. Yeah okay I'm available until probably one o'clock and then I'll be back. You can leave if I'm not here which I should be up until then. Leave it on my answering machine. I would call you as soon as I got back. Okay.

"Hi, this is Karera with Puppy Spot. Who am I speaking with? Carolyn Hansen. All right. What can I help you with? Well, I just had a couple questions. I've never dealt with you before. When you see a puppy that you like, how do you know where it's located? So you would have to call in and talk to us about that. We keep all of the breeders' information private. So is there a particular puppy you're looking at? Yes, but I also wanted to ask, is there any leeway at all on the price? Because some of them are so expensive. Unfortunately not. Those are the prices that the breeders have set, and we can't negotiate with them at all. Oh, okay. But we do offer financing, if that's something you'd like to look into. What is the rate of interest on that? It ranges quite a bit. I can't really give you a general idea, because I've seen it really high. I've seen it pretty low. Typically, I'd like to say on average, it's going to be about like a credit card rate, just because interest rates are super high right now in general for everyone. Okay. All right. Well, the one that I like, if you could tell me where it's located. Do you need the number? Yeah. Okay. It's 731-098. Awesome. Okay, Mario, the Dachshund puppy. Right. Yeah. So he is... I'm sorry. He's a Dachshund. He's a Dachshund, so he's a Dachshund, so he's a Dachshund. I'm so sorry if you hear my dog. He is pushing his toy around. I work from home, so we love to make a lot of noise when we're on the phone. Right. So this puppy here is located in Indiana, but we do offer transportation services. Yeah. Okay. How are they transported? Either by car or by flight. It just kind of depends. We base it off of the puppy's weight and their age at the time. If they qualify, we try to fly them because it's the quickest mode of transportation. And we do use one airline company that we find the most trustworthy for puppy flights just because they have a designated area meant for animals, so they're not in cargo with suitcases or anything like that. Okay. And the other thing is, we have a lot of dogs that are not in the air, so we do have a lot of dogs that are in the air. So we have a lot of dogs that are in the air, so we have a lot of dogs that are in the air. And they're not in the air. So we have a lot of dogs that are in the air.

"Hi, it's Lisa. Hi, Lisa. This is Isabel Barker calling you back from last night. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm well. I'm great. I just wanted to see if you wanted to do like a follow-up or anything. I know you said you were going to call me back last night. I figured it was late, so. Oh, I thought I was waiting for you to call me back. Oh. Well, good thing I called you back, huh? I'm telling you. Hang on. Let me pull up your page. You never want to push because it's such a big decision. Hang on. Why is your page not coming up? What phone number do I have for you? 201-937-4687. There you are. You were looking at Paisley? Yes. Yeah, it was late. I didn't want to call you. I wanted to see when it was good for you. So is this your first puppy? It's the first puppy for my husband and I together. I had one when I was younger but no longer have a dog. Okay, and are you familiar with the Portuguese Water Dogs? Yes, I used to dog sit for one. Okay, they are very immature but not in a bad way. Yeah, they're very playful and goofy. Yeah, that's pretty much what I meant by that. They stay puppy forever. Super smart. They don't shed, which is awesome. And their coat grows a lot slower than a poodle would, so you wouldn't have to take as many trips to the groomers, which is nice. So PuppySpot is a network of breeders. So every breeder – hello? Yes, I'm still here. Oh, I thought I'd hung up. Every breeder on the website is screened and vetted first, so we make sure they have the highest standards in the industry. So let's see, where is Paisley? Ohio. Now, she's five weeks old, so May 18th is when she turns eight weeks. She can have her vaccinations then, and it takes about two to three weeks to arrange for travel. And within the week of travel, she'll have a full health evaluation before she leaves. So we make sure she's perfect because you get 10 years against congenital and hereditary conditions. Okay. And do you know anything about Paisley's parents? Like how is the mom, how is the dad? Mom's actually a therapy dog, and dad loves to run and play with his toys, sleep and hang out. But the breeders do also have children. So there's young and older kids in the home, so they have lots and lots of playtime. I'm actually going to see if I have the pictures of mom and dad. Give me a sec. She has more of her mom's markings. And with the Portuguese water dog, it's all about the haircut. I don't know if you've ever seen, like, the show cut, like, for the champion dog. When they're, like, back legs are naked. Yeah, from the stomach down, it's naked, and then they're, like, long and funny. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I mean. It's all about the grooming. We would probably do more of, like, the retriever look. Yeah, where it's all the same. Now, is Paisley, is she curly or wavy? She looks, she doesn't look curly to me. So her father's curly. The mom's almost like a flatter coat. I did email you. See if you got the picture. Let me see. With Gmail, sometimes it goes to a promotional folder. Okay, let me check, because I am in Gmail. So most of the puppies in this litter have more of a flatter coat than the father. But I like the fur coats. Okay. Yeah, that's what interested me most about her. So I was looking up today to see if she would grow out of her freckles or if they stick with her. They do. They do stay. Oh. I mean, it can get lighter or darker, and the hair could be, it can look different as they grow. Yeah. Did the parents come through? No, I just have, oh, parent photos, yeah. Oh, there we go. Oh. You see how different they look? And mommy just had seven babies, so we're not going to judge her haircut. I like the dad's cut, but he's definitely curlier than she is. Her puppies look more like her, her coat. Yeah, and she does have a lot of the freckles, too. She does. And she likes to be cut pretty short. I think if we let her hair grow out, it will be a little more wavy. Yeah, and you can tell that she's nursing, so they probably have it cut short on purpose so it's not messy. Yeah. Okay. They're cute, though. I love the puppy cut. Like, I love the cut of the dad, but it's so funny how the grooming is different. We had one with champion lines, and I could, every time I looked at the dad, I giggled. Like, it's so silly. But listen, there's a standard for everything, I guess. You know, they all have their own little, like, Schnauzers have that, like, bald back and long cut in the back, kind of like a mullet. And size-wise, you know, they're predicting 40 to, you know, 45 pounds, just like the parents. She'll come with her vaccination report. Her full health examination results are going to come home with her. And, of course, if anything shows up on that exam, we'd have to notify you in advance. This way, if you're not comfortable moving forward, you don't. And she eats eucanupa puppy dry food, so they send you a sample of that, too. Okay. And what exactly has she gotten so far with her vaccination? Nothing yet, because she's five weeks old. Probably just deworming. Okay. But before we get her, we would at least get, like, the first round of that? Yeah, of course. Yep. Okay. It's all age-appropriate. So you can't over-vaccinate either. So whatever is due for her age, she'll have. Okay. And you get copies of it all. Perfect. Yeah. So when she comes home, we ask you to take her to a vet for a wellness exam. I'm laughing at her video. Sorry. They, like, zoomed in, and she's like, what? The poor baby. She's so little. We ask you to take her to the vet, bring all the records with you, and this way they can give her a wellness check and tell you when the next set of boosters are due. Okay. And you'll get, like, updates. So usually the breeders update every two weeks, videos and pictures. I mean, she's literally, you know, four and a half weeks old in this picture and video. It was taken a few days ago. Yes. Tiny, tiny. She's a little. She's a cutie. So the puppies have to be also handled daily. We want to make sure that the kids are very involved. We don't want to send you home a puppy that's afraid, so they're all going to be, you know, pre-spoiled, so to speak. And they're about, like, three and a half, four pounds right now. Yeah. So they're just very small. I think that would be nice, too, just because at least, like, if we end up taking Paisley, my husband and I, he works from home full time, and I go into the office, like, 40%, so we're both majority of the time here, and we have a very big backyard. We just recently bought a house, and that's what we've been waiting for with the dog and everything. So we have we're on about a three-quarter lot acre, completely fenced in. Oh, perfect. When did you move? In March. And I'm assuming you're always from New Jersey, the 201 area code? Yes. Got it. What part? It's up in northern Jersey in Morris County. Okay. So the way travel works, our travel team is going to determine where the puppy is going to be delivered. So they're either driven or flown, probably driven since it's Ohio. It's not that far. But they'll determine whatever is the best option to get the puppy to you. And within seven to ten days, you'll get the travel date, and it should be two to three weeks from her availability date or sooner. But then we have another litter on the website that's a little bit older. I don't know if you saw them. I think Nella is similar looking. She's 15 weeks old. She's very pretty. I did. I think we do want to go with the younger litter. Okay. We were going back and forth with the older litter. Was it Bella you were looking at? I don't know if it was Bella or Bella's sister. Cruz also is gorgeous. He's a little boy. Yeah. He's 11 weeks old. So they come home around like the ten-week mark approximately. Honestly, the longer they stay with their litter mates and the parents, the better. They learn so much just by being with each other. You know what I mean? They learn by example. They learn from mom. Mom does break up puppy fights. So they build confidence just by being together until they meet you. So they're not going to be housebroken yet. That is your job. But you've got a big fenced-in yard to teach them. And the travel fee is a separate rate. It's $711. It covers the cost of all the health certificates and the 10-year health commitment. Tax is based on your zip code. And we can even send you all the accessories she needs, the bed, blanket, bowls, leash, teething bones. Basically, it's a puppy starter kit. It gets FedExed to your house. And we arrange for the activation of the microchips for the rest of their lives. And you'll have all the breeder's information and health paperwork with her when she comes home. Okay. So that would all be included in that $700 fee? No, the activation of the chip is $49. And then the puppy pack, which I'll text you what it is, is $188. But it's heavily discounted and honestly worth it. I just got it because we upgraded it. And we also are remote now. So I saw the original one when it was in the office, so I got to see what it looked like. And I wanted to see it. So I have two dogs. They're both older. Well, not older, two and five. The 2-year-old is from Puppy Spot. And I let him play with the stuff. He thinks he's a puppy. He's really not. He's 120 pounds. I don't know how that happened. So I used him as an example as we can't guarantee the full-grown weight. Amazing stuff. Love it. And he loves all the stuff, even though he's big. But it's all designed for puppies specifically. And it gives you an idea of things they like and don't like. So that we would send you an invoice for everything. The invoice is through a secure site. It's called Bolt. It's a security system. So it protects us both. It's either credit card, debit, or PayPal. And the breeder is notified immediately. And then within seven to ten days, a puppy manager is going to reach out. They're the ones that are coordinating the details of the travel. And you'll know her tentative date and location for pickup. And then usually 72 hours, they'll confirm everything with you. And then while she's growing, you should probably get another update of new pictures and videos in another week or so. They usually update them all together, the whole litter. They have a schedule. It's a lot of work. Especially when it's like eight weeks old. They're not sitting so calm with this zoom in on her face. She's like frozen going, I'm supposed to do what? So as they get older, it's, you know, sometimes they just send in a video. Like that's the best out of 20. So this is what we're doing. I believe you. She's very cute. Love her markings. She is adorable. Maybe what we can do right now, if you wanted to send me the all in quote, and I can discuss everything over with my husband tonight over dinner, and we can get back to you. What is your home address? I have to fill that out to send you an invoice. It's 8 Cathy, C-A-T-H-Y Lane in Chester, New Jersey. And that's it? 07930. Okay. And your billing address would be the same as your home address, right? Yes. Okay. Give me just a moment. Come on, computer. You got this. How long has it been since you had a dog? Since middle school. No. So it's been a really long time, and I've been waiting for the moment to have a backyard, and I finally have a backyard, and that's it. Yay. Well, at least you're smart that you did it after you moved in. We get families sometimes that they're in escrow, and then they want to apply for a loan for the puppy. I'm like, stop. Freeze. Don't do that. Yeah, that's a very bad idea. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I'm like, what do you want more, the house or the puppy? Because you're only getting one at this point. You're not closing anymore because you just applied for a line of credit. Like you literally applied for a loan. Go call your mortgage broker. You can call me back if you want to. All right. Give me a sec. I'm just saving your information. No problem. I love the Portuguese water dogs too. They are honestly the best. They're so cute. I love that they don't shed. They're fun. They're amusing. They're little clowns. They're active. Do you have a pool in your backyard? Unfortunately not, but we do live 20 minutes from the lake. Oh, nice. But you could also do sprinklers. And what I did for my dogs, now I have a pool that when I didn't, I bought those big resin pools from Walmart for like 20 bucks. It's probably a little bit more at this point. And they would go nuts in it. I'd put like ball pit, make it into a water ball pit, and they would just run around and spend like all their time in that little pool. It was fun and cheap. Did you have Portuguese water dogs? No, I had a lamb. At the time. And they love water too. And my big shepherd, he was a long coat. So he was hot. So he would just lay in there. The lab would like jump over him. He's just like, no, no, no. He was older. He's like, I'm just laying here. Hot outside. I'm just going to sit. And then my kids had to squeeze in. My little kids wanted to also be in the pool. It was, it was, it was fun. I learned about the resin pool because I bought those big blow up ones. And with the dogs, they would, you know, it was very long. Yeah. And the resin pools was actually cheaper. So everything altogether with everything, the 10 year health commitment, the activation of the chip, the puppy pack. Vaccines, the puppy, the delivery. 4101 and 87 cents. But I'm going to email it to you. So you can see it. It's the contract that's attached to it. And if you know that you want it, you can get it. And if you don't, you can get it. And it's attached to it. And if you know that you want her, you can definitely go ahead and make a payment on her because I'll see it. And I can just go over, like, recap everything later on. That's totally up to you. I did put her on a brief reserve just to refresh the system. 12 other people filled out a request for her at this point. Gotcha. Okay. It doesn't mean that 12 people have their wallets out. It means 12 people did what you did. You sent something and emailed us about her. Yeah. All right. Thank you for letting me know. Yeah, of course. Listen, it's still a big decision. You're bringing home a new family member. Your first child in that house, I think, right? Yeah. As long as you agree to have her spayed, our puppies are not for, you know, breeding purposes. Take out health insurance on her because it's very, very smart to have it. And very expensive not to. I'm the poster child of that. I just changed my insurance to the one that we offer. Got a great rate. But, listen, it's a big deal. So talk to your husband. He saw her already? Yeah, we both saw her last night, but I just wanted to show him the parents and just go over all the finances with it. You got it. And we also take PayPal credit if you wanted to use PayPal. Okay. Or either regular PayPal or PayPal credit. Gotcha. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. And if you think of any other questions, feel free to reach out. You can text me, e-mail me, or give me a call. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll talk to you soon. All righty. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquires about purchasing a Portuguese Water Dog puppy named Paisley from PuppySpot.

Yep, Cocker Spaniel. Let me see how old he was. I'll pull him back up here. 17 weeks old. 17 weeks. Yeah. Okay. That's gonna be tough. We were looking more for an adult dog. Yeah, something that's housebroken already. Yeah, I'd imagine you guys mostly specialize in puppies. Yeah, most of the pups do kind of get gone after eight weeks, they're ready to go home. And then normally once they get about 10, 12 weeks, the price starts going down. And then that kind of makes them go a little bit faster. Gotcha. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. I thought this was a different one. Hey, no worries. Yeah. Hey, good luck finding him a home though. It looks like a great dog. It looks really good. Absolutely. Yeah, he's pretty close. I think he's like 17 weeks. That puts him, he's almost five months old there. So he'll be fully grown soon. Yeah. Wait, five months? Yeah. Is he potty trained? Yeah, right now he is going to the bathroom outside. Let me see. They never used, this breeder didn't use potty pads. They just went straight to potty training outside. Yeah, so he is already going to the bathroom outside. That being said, you'll probably have to do a little bit of socialization to your house once you get him out. Absolutely. Where is he located? Let me see. Zion would be coming to you from Indiana. All right. That's another deal breaker. Our dog, the rescue, and she's a little tented in puppies, higher energy dogs kind of freak her out. So we're trying to find- Yeah, I think they want to meet at first. Yeah. We're trying to find another timid dog. Just, she's no longer super timid. Just, how do I put it? If we got another version of her, like when we first got her five years ago, she would help that dog open up. That was cool to see.

"Hi, this is Karrera. I'm at the spot you're speaking with. Hi, good morning. My name is David Bursch. How are you doing this morning? I am good, and how are you? I'm doing quite well, thank you so much for asking. Good, good. What can I help you with? I'm actually calling just to do a little reconnaissance work on behalf of my mother-in-law. I was just wondering a handful of things. She was interested in using PuppySpot to get a puppy, and she's not too tech savvy, and we were wondering, or I was wondering, if this is something that we could do over the phone as opposed to necessarily using the internet if we know which particular puppy and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, some of it will have to be online. How that works is, let's say I can help you find a puppy. I can send you a few different puppies, unless you found one that you like. If you wanted to go through with the process, I would do a screening with you. I would write up the invoice myself, and then all I would have to do is send you the invoice. If I may, you just confirm your information is correct, put in your card info, and then that's it. That's all you would have to do on the computer yourself. Perfect. That shouldn't be a problem. Can I ask you, are you able to look up puppies by chance? Are you able to, and you can tell me no, are you able to tell me approximately what region a puppy is from? Absolutely, yeah. Which puppy is it that you're looking at? 731924. How cute. So adorable. Archie Lee. That's correct. Okay, let's see. So, Archie Lee is located in Missouri, but we do offer transportation services as well. Okay, that's perfect. Yeah, super excited about the opportunity to, we're in Baltimore, Maryland. So, it's just a hop and a skip away. Cool. Yeah. Perfect. So, if we want to move forward, we can just at some point give somebody a call back and just say, you know, we're interested in doing this and then we'll, you know, do that and then all we need to do, the only part on the computer again, is just sending over a thing to confirm and enter information. Is that correct? Yeah, yep, that's it. Yeah. Awesome. And you said this is a puppy for your mother-in-law? Correct. Okay, and what is her name? Because I already pulled up a profile and I want to make sure it's her. Oh, cool. Her name is Ina Lee Gekler, which is I-N-A L-E-E Gekler, which is G as in George, G-E-C-K-L-E-R. Awesome. Okay, and then what was your name? My name is David Bersh, B as in boy, B-E-R-S-C-H. B, okay, hold on, wait, do the last name one more time. B as in boy, B-E-R-S-C-H. Okay, cool, I had it right. I just like to double check. That's great. Okay, cool. Okay, so let me see here, would this be her first puppy? I'm not a true puppy spot, but I think probably about seventh or eighth dog in her X amount of years in life. I'm not going to say a number. Oh, okay, yeah, no, absolutely, totally get that. Well, awesome. Well, I'm glad she's looking to get another little poodle. Is this her first poodle or? I think first poodle. She has had a wide range of dogs throughout her lifetime, but I think first poodle. Okay, well, poodles are great dogs, great, great, great dogs. That will be something awesome for her. They're super smart. They're, you know, very adaptable to different lifestyles. They're just great dogs, and they're so loyal, so loyal. I love poodles. Yeah, I am very excited, and I'm sure she's also very excited. I'm also very excited to talk to somebody on the phone and know that it's real. I mean, just because we know we never use a service like this before. Yeah, yeah. Somebody real on the other line, and it's really very encouraging. It is, yeah. And if you'd like, since you're interested in Archie Lee, I can send you photos of what his parents look like. That would actually be wonderful. Yeah. I would like to offer, because we don't leave that public, just because we want to reduce the chances of, like, scammers stealing that and using it on another website. Right. So, we'd like, here, let me see. Do you have a phone number I can text them to you? Yeah, actually, you could probably text it to her number, which is 410- 913. 913. 5144. 5144. Awesome. Okay. Let me go ahead and save that, and then I can text her what the parents look like. Okay. And when I first called you, the phone over here cracked a little bit. What was your name? Oh, Carrera. Carrera. Beautiful. Thank you so much. Yeah, it's a bit of an odd name, but my dad's a bit of a car enthusiast, so he decided to name me after a Porsche. No, that's amazing. I like Carrera, though, instead of Porsche. I mean, even though Porsche would be a nice name, too. Yeah, see, that's what I said. I was like, at least it was Carrera and not Porsche, because I don't know if I could have done Porsche. Porsche or Alexis, or, well, actually, Alexis. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, yeah. So, I went ahead and I sent over those photos. So, the mom is going to be the one with the bandana, and the dad is the one with the blue collar on. Actually, is it possible, her phone is actually charging, to send it over to mine at the moment? Absolutely, yeah. I can give you. What is the number? 410-218-0702. Awesome. I'm going to save that. All right. I'll have it coming through in a second. Wow, look at this. Aren't they cute? This is actually his parents. Oh, okay. This is something that Puppy Spot doesn't put on publicly, because of scammers and things like that. But they do, when people are interested, allow people to see the parents. Yeah, we just want to talk to you first to make sure you're not going to run off with the photos and post them somewhere else. Right, right, right. This is great. Those are Archie's parents. So my handful of questions is, you know, this is not – once we're ready to – if we do or do not do this, you know, pull the trigger. Yeah, since you're so kind and wonderful, is it something where we can call back and say, may we speak to Carera? We've been talking to her about Archie Lee. Absolutely. Okay, great. Yeah, so I can actually have it set up to where any time you call or text in during my shift for the next, like, two days, it should come directly to my line first. But I can text you our number with my extension as well. Oh, yeah, that would be great. If you text it to the one that you just did. To your number? Yeah, I'll pass it on. Okay, cool. That's amazing. And now I do work – I'm in a different time zone from you, so I do work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central. Central, okay. So I believe you're – yeah, I think you're an hour ahead of me. Yeah, we're EST, yeah, Eastern. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Cool. So I'll be here 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. your time then. Great. Yeah. So, yeah, how soon are you guys looking to get her a puppy? You know, it could happen today, it could happen tomorrow, it could happen in two weeks, three weeks. Yeah, absolutely. It'll be this week sometime. It'll be this week sometime, she's saying. Okay, so do some eager. Yeah. I get that. I think it's kind of like a female thing. Once you know you want something, you're like, we're doing it. We're doing it, yeah. Yeah. That's great. I'm the same way. Like, when I got my dog, it kind of sucked for my husband because I was like, hey, by the way, we're getting a dog tomorrow. And he was like, uh… Okay, yeah. Great. And that's how I went with both of my dogs. Like, my second dog, I told him, I was like, hey, by the way, we got to drive three hours to get this dog in a couple days. And he's like, what? What? And I was like, all right, but we need to get a car first. And he was like, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But yeah. Well, okay, so is there any other questions I can answer for you? Not at the moment, but hold on one second. So I've been talking to a wonderful woman named Carrera. When we call back, we'll be able to speak directly to her. Did you want to talk to her for a minute or two or do you want to wait until we call back? She's super nice. My mother-in-law, Ina, is going to talk to you for a minute or two, if that's okay? Yeah, absolutely. Go for it. All right. If I don't talk to you on this phone call again, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time out and talking with me. And I'm going to pass you along to Ina. Awesome. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you. Hi, Carrera. This is Ina. Hi. How are you? Hi. I'm fine. This is a real big step for me. I have not had a puppy in, I guess, 12 years. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I have right now a French bulldog that is – she'll be 12 this year. Oh, my gosh. I love Frenchies. I do, too. So cute. I love her very much and I don't want to hurt her feelings. You know what I mean? Yeah. I – if – this dog, Archie, he won't get more than 8 pounds, will he? Let me pull up his profile. Oh, no, definitely not. So his mom is 4 1⁄2 pounds and his dad is 5 pounds. Okay. Yeah. And are these dogs – will he be crate trained or how will that work? Let me see. Let me see. Because I know a lot of our breeders don't really use kennels or anything. They usually just, you know, let them roam around the house as if they live there, which is nice. But it doesn't show that they're crate trained, no. Okay. Let me see. Has it been dewormed? Yes. So he will be up to date on all of his vaccinations. He'll be dewormed. He – they also use the AKC for their registration, so his litter is already registered. They don't register the individual puppy because that's something for you to do so it can be in your name. But the litter is already registered, so the process is already started for you. Okay. Now, how do you – how do you pay for this? So if you were wanting to move forward with Archie Lee, what I would do is I would do a screening with you. Once that screening is done, I would email you an invoice, and from there you can type in a credit card, a debit card. You can do whatever you want to pay for the puppy. And then I would transport your file to the transportation department, and they'll get started on it. Okay. I would write a check for the puppy. I don't know whether I – what is your form of financing? Is it Synchrony Bank? So we have different kinds of financing. We have PayPal credit, which is Synchrony goes through PayPal for the credit line, so you could use the PayPal credit line. Or we have one through Paris Financing, which is kind of like a personal loan, honestly. Okay. And if we're not able to take a check, we would just have to use, like, our payment processing team because it's just a secure thing that can do chargebacks and stuff like that. Okay. So that way, yeah, it's just a little easier. Okay. So you could use a credit card or a debit card through that payment processing, and I would send it to you so that way you can put it in yourself. We don't take card and fill over the phone. It's just not safe anymore. Okay. All right. Well, I will probably be giving you a call back probably today. Is there any way to reserve the puppy? Absolutely. So I can go ahead, if you would like, I can just place him on a complimentary hold for a few hours today. Okay. If you'd like, how long are you wanting me to place him on hold for? I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. How many hours would you like me to place him on hold for? Five o'clock. Five o'clock. Okay. Let me save that here. Okay, cool. And then I can give you a call around the time that the hold is about to end, if you'd like. Yeah, that would be great. Push me along. Yeah, absolutely. And just to give you a heads up, obviously, because I believe, yeah, we already have a lot of people looking at him, which is not surprising because he's super cute. Yeah. Well, I'm 99% sure I want him. Yeah, absolutely. You just got to get that one more percent. I'm right there with you. I get that. Yeah, okay. All right. Well, I will give you a call back by five o'clock. Okay, sounds good. If there's anything else you need, just give me a text or a call. All right. Thank you. Not a problem. You have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer called to inquire about purchasing a puppy from PuppySpot.

"Hello, can I help you? Hi, is there anyone who can speak with Susan? This is she. Hey, Susan, my name is Derek. I'm actually giving you a call over at Puppy Spot. How are you? Fine. Awesome. Just wanted to give you a call in regards to Joanna, the golden doodle here. I wanted to know if you had any questions by any means. I see that you filled out basically the majority of the application, which I do appreciate. I just wanted to know if you guys have any questions over there. Oh, yeah, I'm not interested with all the add-ons, all that stuff. I'll just look around here. Gotcha. So you weren't the travel and the health that was kind of holding you up? Well, I don't know where the dog is coming from. I don't know what kind of background she has. I don't know what the OFA of her parents is, if she's had any shots or anything. So with the big unknown, I probably was in comfort to try and buy her. I think you're – I don't know – I don't understand why you have so many puppies. You know, the phrase puppy mill kind of stick, you know, blooms up. I can appreciate it. I understand exactly what you're thinking. Well, now to just – again, I know you want a little bit more locally and things like that. To tell you just we don't work with puppy mills. The reason why we have so many puppies on our site is because we work with so many great breeders throughout the United States here. So, again, you know, one litter of puppies could be, you know, anywhere between four to potentially six to eight puppies there. So that's why we work with a large number of breeders who are all doing the right thing. Again, we vet these breeders very intensely to get up on Puppy Spot here. So, again, not working with puppy mills by any means. It's one of our promises here. And the puppy is coming from South Dakota. So, again, I know that you were wondering where that puppy was coming from. That's where the breeder is located with Joanna currently. But, yeah, again, I know there's a lot of unknowns. And that's why we have you guys reach out to a representative like myself to fill you in on a lot of this information to show you why it's obviously, you know, why we are a great company and why we're able to travel a puppy to you a thousand percent, you know, safely. Right. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, I still don't know anything about her parents' OFA or her parents' pedigree or anything. And the $3,500 I can go down, I can go five miles away and spend $3,500 knowing exactly what I'm getting. Get the puppy right there. Not have the puppy go through the trauma of the airplane. But they do survive that because I shipped a puppy over to Germany once when I was raising Golden Doodle. Oh, yeah, they definitely survive. Again, we would never put a puppy in a scenario where we would be iffy if they would, you know, survive the trip by any means. You know, we've traveled over 200,000 puppies at this point over the last 19 years here. So we know the best ways to do it, of course. And in regards to the parents, just so you know, just to give you a little bit more information, the father is APR registered. The female is unregistered. What's an APR? Give me one quick second. There's so many different ones. So I just want to make sure that I tell you the right one. The American Pet Registry. Yeah, that's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure. Okay. The mother is unregistered, just so you know, as a Golden Doodle. The father is APR, F for a poodle, correct? F for poodle? F for? No, no, no. For the poodle. Yeah, F-O-R. Sorry, for the poodle, he is APR registered. For the female, she is unregistered due to her being a Golden Doodle and the father being a pure poodle. Okay, so she's an F-O, F-1B. Correct, correct. Okay. Yeah, of course. Yeah, but I'm sorry, I'm still not interested at this point. No, it's very much okay. I'm not going to pay all those extra car charges. Yeah, no, not a problem at all. I just wanted to obviously, you know, show you because, again, someone could ask you in the future, hey, have you ever talked to Puppy Spot or something like that? You can give them, you know, you can tell them that, yeah, of course, they're legit. Again, I just want a good name about Puppy Spot. Again, that's why we have you guys call us in so I can provide you with all this information. But I understand completely that you're not looking to pay the extra fees and things like that. Obviously, totally fair on your end here. So if anything changes, though, Susan, you have our number. And the parents, you did mention that they are OFA parents, so their hips, their knees, and their ankles. So I find that a very – Oh, no, I'm sorry. I didn't even hear you ask that. Of course. Especially when it comes to the breed that we understand, you know, Golden Doodles, you know, they do have a lot of issues with their hips and joints and things like that. Of course, we are making sure of all of that. We do not list any puppies where the parents have any preexisting issues because in our Puppy Spot promise, we are only fully selling you a fully healthy puppy here. So, again, we cannot even list any puppy that might have any sort of, you know, medical issue by any means here. So, yes, the puppy itself, and you would receive like a full report of that. So, like, you would be able to see the puppy is fully healthy, has all the shots, vaccines, and dewormings here. So, again, I know you're not interested. I don't want to take up too much of your time here, but you have our number just in case you ever, you know, you ever need us. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day. Bye-bye. You too. ♪♪♪","{'Summary': ""The customer called to inquire about a golden doodle puppy named Joanna.

"Hello? Hi, John. It's Andrea from Puppy Spot. Oh, hi, Sheeta. How are you doing? I tell you, I got... I'm good. How are you? Where are you located at? I'm actually in Michigan. Oh, you have a 940... No, what's your number? 954-325-4000. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hi, John. What's your number? 9-5-4. Is your area code? Is it within the Florida area? Our phone lines, our phone system is routed from Florida. Oh, okay. Yeah, I was looking at the dog and he went, and he sold him, huh? Yeah. The breeder sold him. Yeah. So, what do the dogs say? What's the breeders' and then do you have to get him from them and get him back and so forth? Is that what happens? is actually they stay with the breeders and once they're purchased, then the breeder gets their USDA health examination completed and then we arrange all the travel and then they travel them to you directly. Yeah, I tell you, I really wouldn't, I wouldn't get that. I like the one that JoJo and then the one I really like was Zelda when they went is going. So I kind of got cold feet on it. I got to make sure I want the dog too, you know what I'm saying? I've got your number right here. I didn't, I didn't, I probably would have bought that dog but now that I'm just thinking about all the, you know, all the training and all that stuff. I hope I don't want to take a dog and not be able to do it, you know what I'm saying? I understand. If I get a dog, I would do it. You know, you put a lot of time in it, I feel bad. Oh, absolutely. No, that's the second one, you know, I probably would have had a dog by now. The thing that really turns me off is I don't like the shipping thing. There's nothing you can do about it. Right. You know, because when you get the dog in, you got to ship it down there by plane and all that. It might be two or three weeks and so forth, so on. I don't know. But you don't have a lot of labs. I was looking at them and, you know, you got that, the only the two left, right? Well, we, I mean, in the older pups, we don't have a whole lot of the older ones. Yeah, the older ones, but actually we have more than I thought because there's still some from that litter. Where's that other dog? They're from Missouri. The white ones are from some place in Indiana, I assume. I know the other ones are from Missouri. I know the white ones, they're from up, they're up in Indiana someplace, but the other dogs from Missouri, that trainer, it seems like that she really, she probably doesn't even look like a trainer. She probably just doesn't look like she has a lot of dogs. I don't know. Her dogs are really look, they're really calm, you know? Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you know, right, and I mean that breeder still has the four, the other four from the litter, the Hank, Sherman, Lola, and Chudy. I got to look at them. Let me ask you about the female dogs. The females probably, you got the females are nice too, but they have to be fixed also, right? Yeah. And that happens about the same time, nine months, or how do they do that? Actually, typically when you're doing labs now, they're actually recommending more of the year, year and a half type age group because they find that, well, they find that there's some of the hormones are helping with the bone growth and the growth plates, so they are recommending them a little bit, a little bit older. Yeah. Well, I got your number right here, Angie. I mean, if I do anything, I'm going to call you. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not getting, no. If I do buy a dog, and I kind of just got a little, I couldn't believe it. The birth date was Sunday, so I would, when I told you to do it, you say, I said, JoJo, I said, you know what, I'll probably just get, because they're both American, so I said, I'd better get off because I like American, so I guess I'll give it to you too late. I'll call you the next day. And the reason I didn't return, I saw your, you sent me that email, I appreciate it, you sent me the email, I mean the text. Yeah, I was watching them for you. So what happens, you don't have any trade on that, so if I was to buy a dog now, somebody else, some other salesman might have got somebody else, you never know until you, you know, you know what I'm saying? Well, once you, once you decide, once you, once we have someone that decides they want to purchase a puppy, and we actually put the puppy on reserve and start the purchase process, which we can't reserve them for more than two hours, but what it does is our system, the breeder, our system outreaches to the breeder, and because they can, they go and they look into their, their computer, their, they get a login, so they look in there and see what the status of their puppies are. So if they're on reserve, that if they're on reserve with us, then they, they know not to, you know, that not to accept any offers. Okay, so I'm just, I've just been looking at it, if I see something up there, if I decide, or I'm going to wait and see if something comes up, I'll give you a call, if I definitely just, I'm going to ask for you, I got your number anyway. Well, I appreciate that. I definitely will, because you put some time in, but I just don't want to, you want to jump into something I'm not 100%, you know what I'm saying? You know, I agree. I would have bought that, the dog, I definitely would have bought the one dog, Marcus, that was done, and that was Sunday night, and so, I, you know, I almost, I said, well, I'll get him in the morning, and when I couldn't believe he went like that, it was unbelievable, because I was, because that dog was a nice dog, I could just tell, you know, and whenever, you got the other one, and then I made my mind up, I think I'll go take the brown one, because of Jojo, and when he went in, I didn't really sleep in. Aw. So don't worry about it. Well, I tell you, I know you, I know you weren't too keen on the English, the English body, Englishes. No, I don't like, I like the Americans, you know, there's not too many, but, you know, they're long, I just like them better, I don't know why. I probably, because I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I like, I just like, I don't like that, the short, fatty ones, you know, but those aren't, those English ones look big anyway. They're pretty nice. Well, I was actually going to point, yeah, I was actually going to point you to a different breeder, because I know this breeder works with her dogs when they get older. She actually is a, she's been breeding for 30 years, but she has an older one that's available. His name is Free, she is, her name is Freely. She's 19 weeks, and you can watch in her video. They've already got. I've seen her, I've seen her dog. I've seen her, she's on the line. Yeah, she's a good dog, I've seen her. She's a female. Yep, yep, they've already got her working with the heel, and you can tell just by the video that they're actually working with her. Oh, yeah. So. Yeah, that's a nice dog, but she's a female. Yeah, I've seen her. Yeah, she's a good dog. And they probably want to sell her. How old is that dog? He's pretty old now. She's 19 weeks. She's 19 weeks. Maybe the pictures, you know, those pictures are the ones we got. They're probably older now, the ones that are 19 weeks. You know, they're probably a little bit bigger now, too. The two white ones that are left, I assume. Well, those, yeah, I would assume they're because of the photos. Drew actually just had his photos updated yesterday. Oh, okay. So there's some new photos on there. So where are the dogs? Those dogs are with the, where they come from, the breeder, like the one in Indiana, wherever that is. Is that with the, they keep the dogs, and then when you sell them, they give you the dog? Is that what they do? Once we, once the puppy gets sold, we take all the payment for them and everything. And then we actually. You know, my question, the reason it takes time is, you know, the dogs, wherever you got them originally, they're the breeders, what you're saying, correct? So what we do. You don't call them up and say you want the dog now, I get you. No, what we do is we actually arrange all of the travel. We already let the breeder know with the, with the, through the computer that the puppy's been sold. And we've arranged all the travel and the puppy needs to be ready. You know, once you get your USDA health certificate completed, we'll have all the arrangements made for the puppy to travel. You'll need to have the puppy at the location for pickup. At, okay, all right, I'm looking for now. Hello, I'm here. Oh, I didn't forget also. So where are you? Where do you live? I'm personally in Michigan. I'm personally, I'm personally in Michigan. Michigan, okay, it's getting warm up there. I'm still sitting with a blanket on. Hey, listen, thank you for calling. And I'll get in touch. I'm going to go look at that. I'm going to go look at that. Philly is a good dog. I noticed that. Thank you very much. And if I do anything, I will get right now. I'm not going to do anything. Until I'm 100% but if I do, I'll give you a call. All righty, not a problem. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'The customer called to inquire about purchasing a puppy but ultimately decided not to make a purchase at this time.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Jacob. Yes, I was wondering do you all have any Boston Terrier puppies? Boston Terrier puppies, let me check for you. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with while I'm pulling this up? Larry Western. Nice to meet you, Larry. What brings you to Puppy Spot besides looking for a Boston Terrier? I was just looking through some ads and I called Cape, Gerada, they didn't have anything. So where are y'all located? So at Puppy Spot we don't have a set location. That way we can avoid keeping the pups in cages in the store or something like that. They all stay with their breeders and their mom until they're ready to go home in a home environment. That way it's an easier transition from one house to another. But right now I've got breeders in Arkansas, Indiana, and Ohio. Arkansas, Indiana. Well, the closest to me would be Arkansas. Let's see how many I've got out in there. Oh, it looks like those are reserved. Okay. Yeah. So all the Boston Terrier pups I have in Arkansas right now are reserved. I can keep an eye out and see if any of those don't actually go through. But yeah, so at the moment we've only got a pick from those two other states, Indiana and Ohio. Now are you looking for like a female, a male? A male. Male Boston Terrier pup. Let me see. Have you had Boston's before? Yeah, I had one a few years back, but he passed. He had got a rare blood disorder and he passed away. That's tough. Well, one thing that'll give you some peace of mind with Puppy Spot at least is all of our puppies are vet checked before we either send them home or set up a meet up to where you can come pick them up. And we'll send you a copy of that. And then we also genetically test the parents, make sure the breeders are doing everything right. And we offer a 10 year health commitment too, because we're so strict. But it looks like right now I've got how many? Five Boston Terrier pup males. Abbott, Fletcher, Christopher, Axel. Are you able to pull up Puppy Spot right now? Well, I'm on my lunch break at the moment. Okay, no worries. If you want to give me your email, what I can do is send some over via email. Okay. All right. It's LarryWestern67 at gmail.com. Perfect. Okay, Larry. And then what would be the best time like tomorrow or the next couple of days for me to reach out and see what you think of the puppies, see how everything's going? Anytime after 2.30. And then where did you say you were calling from? Just to make sure I got the time right. I'm calling from Saxton, Missouri. All right. So is it 12.48 over there? Sir? What time is it where you're at? It is about 11.45. Okay. Just make sure I got that. Make sure I got the right time down here. So what I do here is I'll send over the puppies I got here, the Boston's, and then I'll touch base tomorrow and see what you think of them. Okay. Sound like a plan? Okay. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Do you have any questions for me while you still got me here? No. No. I'll just wait to see what you got. Yeah. Well, what are the prices running on those? Okay. Yeah. Right now, $2,600 to $3,600. Depends on how old it is, where it's at, the color, all that sort of stuff. Oh, okay. All right. So you've got the prices on them. Okay. So you'll be able to see what they are. All right. Then thank you. Yep. No problem, Larry. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Larry called Puppy Spot to inquire about Boston Terrier puppies.

"Hello. Hi, this is Andrea from Puppy Spot. Hi. How are you? I'm good, thank you. How are you? I'm doing great, thank you for asking. I was reaching out because you put in an inquiry about Camila the Bernadudo. Yes. I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I'm able to answer that. I'm sorry. I'm not sure if I'm able to answer that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is there anything you need to do? Can I get a bunch of resources? OK. And I just wanted to answer your. OK. Hi. I said I just was reaching out because you put in an inquiry about Camila the Bernadudo. Yes. And I wanted to answer your questions. OK. Are they in the, what Bernadudos do you have in the DFW area so we can actually go and see them first? Well, with Puppy Spot, we do not have the option for you to go and do a prepurchase visitation. Oh, okay. All of our breeders are thoroughly screened and vetted to ensure that they are quality, upstanding breeders doing the best breeding practices and have no violations against their USDA or their state licensures. We also have a team that actually goes in and inspects all their facilities, goes through all their operational history, all their breeding history, and all of their veterinary history. And they do that inspection annually. Okay. All right. We were kind of hoping that we can go and see one which would be a nice fit. We can go and choose one and then see how our other dog reacts to it sometimes. Because we have a Bernadudo already. And we obviously want to make the right match as they're going to be spending like 12 years or so together. Right, right. I don't know how breeders are doing it these days, but I know that my breeders that I used to work with when I was in practice, they did not allow other dogs to come into the facilities because there's too much likeliness of... So you want to make sure definitely that you ask ahead of time. They might have... They're doing that for the protections of their puppies too because of disease. And again, you're dealing with a dog, you don't know how it's going to react to a puppy or how then they're concerned about puppies and puppies getting injured. So what's the process with this? I mean, where is Camilla right now? Camilla, come in. Camilla is currently in Indiana. Okay. So she would be shipped. How much is that? The travel is $711. Okay. On top of the $2,500? Correct. Okay. Do you have any in this area that we could...we would pick up? Let me see what I have. If I have... Typically, I can look by state, but I don't know for sure as far as... Yeah, I'm in Texas. Yeah, I know. We'll travel about three or four hours. Let me see. I have a breeder in the Oklahoma area. Where in Oklahoma? I can tell you close to which airport. That's about the only thing I have about the... I don't get the exact location. Oh, okay. We would be looking at somewhere near... It says near Kansas. Wichita, Kansas is their preferred airport. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's probably a pretty good haul for you then. I don't have any in Texas. Okay. Well, I'll reach out. We'll see. We're doing some more research on our end. And then if nothing kind of works out, we'll give you guys a shout and then look into shipping them. I do have a few in the... It looks like miniatures though. Is that one a standard you were looking at? No, I mean miniature is... We're looking for a tri-color. Okay. Let me see. I'm looking to see if they have tri-colors here. Nope, this one doesn't have any tri-colors. They have a couple of merle and tans, but... And black and white. Can you send me some pictures of the ones that you have here in Texas? And then... Nope, these aren't Texas. These are Arkansas. I was looking to see if they were... Oh, Arkansas. Okay. Yeah. Which airport they were near. So Fort Smith or Northwest Arkansas, which I don't know which. It's probably going to be up in the northern area of Arkansas. So probably still a good drive for you. Yeah. So yeah, I don't have anything that's going to be like really close that you could probably do a breeders meet up. Yeah. All right then. Well, thanks for reaching out to me. I'll do some more research and then if there's anything else comes up that we just fall in love with, I'll reach out. Absolutely. All right. Thank you. Happy to help. You're welcome. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about a specific Bernadoodle named Camila and asked about the possibility of visiting breeders in the DFW area.

"Hi, it's Lisa from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? Hi, Lisa. This is Michael. I just got a call from you. Yeah, you were looking at Rosie, the golden retriever. Yep. So we actually talked to somebody a couple of days ago. Okay. Judith. We talked to Judith, one of your coworkers. But basically, the biggest thing right now is, you know, we like the dog, but, you know, the biggest thing, I read up on Terrace Finance, and I see that they only require like a 550 credit score to get approved. That's fine. But the biggest thing is that, you know, they do a soft pull on your credit, but by giving them consent to do the soft pull, they in turn also give consent for every single one of their lenders to run a hard pull on me. Yeah, I always say it's a hard pull. I don't go for the soft pull stuff. Yeah. So it says Terrace runs a soft pull, but, you know, if there's going to be six credit checks. There's not going to be six credit checks. So what they're going to do... So $3,000, not going to do that. Right. So you don't have to use Terrace if you don't want to. But what happens is, Terrace is the company. There's three lenders that work under them. So once you submit your application to Terrace, with the soft pull, they're going to match you with one of the lenders. And once they match you, it'll be a hard pull. But you can call them also to be sure, because I'm not the lender, obviously. But we also take PayPal credit. Do you have a PayPal account? Yeah, I don't have PayPal credit, but I have heard that it's actually pretty good. PayPal credit is good. You do have to have a higher credit score for PayPal. They look at your credit score, your income, and your history with PayPal. So let's say you signed up for PayPal now, and your credit score was high enough, and your income was high enough. If you don't have history with them, they might approve you for a credit line, but they won't let you use it all at once, because they don't know what to gauge it off of. Yeah. No, cool. Okay. So what if I give you American Express? Do you guys take that? Of course we take American Express. Okay. So you guys take American Express. I always say use whatever, any kind of credit card. Credit, debit, you can also split the payments with different cards. If you want to do half on an Amex, half on Visa, half on... or debit, that's all fine. It comes up as Puppy Spot Group on your statement. Okay, great. That helps a lot. Okay. Honestly, I like not using financing if you don't have to, because that interest rates can be high. Right. Well, yeah, I already have credit cards. So okay, good. That clears up a lot for me. And have you had a Golden before? No, my wife has though. Okay. Is she on the line? Yeah, you're on speaker. Hi. Hi. You chose a very good looking puppy, by the way. Yeah. I love Goldens. I have mine for eight years. Unfortunately, she has a heart condition and she died. Yeah. But she was like the best. You know, like Goldens are amazing. I love them also. I have one. Also, but do you have one? I do. So I'm very, very biased. I can tell because like my Golden was incredible. Like she was like so smart. They're so sweet. Both of the parents are actually therapy dogs and Rosie's mom. Do you know what? Have you heard of what OFA certification means? OFA is for, no, I don't. I think it's not for like support. No. So OFA stands for the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or Orthopedic Foundation of America. It's basically, it's a panel of veterinarians that will independently analyze x-rays. So let's say the breeder wanted to test the father, which the father can produce a lot more puppies than the mom can. So for Rosie's dad, they tested his elbows, hips, his heart and his knees. So they take x-rays of all those things. They forward the x-rays to the Orthopedic Foundation, OFA, and a panel of veterinarians independently analyze the x-rays to see if there's predisposition for any kind of issue. So they were checking for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, heart disease, and luxating patellas. This is what we have, yeah, dysplasia. They checked for that too. They are checking? Yes. It's difficult? Yeah, the dad had all those testings done. So listen, there's no guarantees in anything in life, but they're checking to see if the parent is predispositioned. The test can only be accurate at two years old. The dad is also a therapy dog, and the mom is a therapy dog. They wrote that she is here. Did you see the parent photos? No, we didn't have the parent photos. And actually, I sent a text, but I don't think you guys get a text for the number I received her call. Oh, probably not. I actually have a video from her in the website, and I wish I can see a video. I think they must be uploading new pictures because the format on the website is a little weird, because it's like missing two boxes. So I'm assuming there would be one. She had 10 puppies in her litter. She's big already. She's like, let me see, she has a brother named Oak who's on the site too. He does have his video up there. So again, I'm assuming they're in the process of updating it. I don't think I'd be able to – How old is she? She's like 12? No, 13? She's 13 weeks, but she's already like 30, 35 pounds. She's big. She's going to be big. Yeah, mine was like huge. Everyone thinks mine was like a male, because the one I used to have was like very, very big. She was like trampoline too. Hang on, I'm emailing you. I'm not emailing, sorry, I'm texting you. Rosie's mom. She looks more like her dad, actually. Frisco is his brother? No. Oh, right. Sorry, what's her brother named? Oak. Oak. O-A-K. That was mom's photo. I'm sending you dad now. No, that's the dad, no. That's the mom. The mom's the darker one. There you go, Rosie. Oh. So they wrote a really nice description about the mom. They wrote that she is their favorite, exclamation point. She has a super therapeutic and amazing temperament. They wrote amazing in all capital letters. She's also super easy to train, loves to give hugs. So if you happen to stop by and she will promise to give you one of her best hugs, which is really cute that they wrote that. And again, they wrote, she is my favorite. And she's also a therapy dog. That's great. Both of them are therapy dogs. And she's located in Indiana. The brother's really cute too. So out of the ten, it's only these two left. Can you send me a picture of the brother? I was trying to find the website, but I didn't find it. So go on to the search on the website. Do you see where it says search for breed? No. I think it's because mine is like female. Let me see. If you just type into the search oak, it will come up. I don't know. I think it's because I am in the area. I see the video of oak. This is the environment that the puppy is living in. Oh, my God, this is really cute. Hang on, I'm going to email it to you then. Here he is. Golden Retriever 13. Oh! Look at the video. Cute. His face is adorable. He's so cute. I have a boy. What? No. I don't want to like a male. Do you want to know a secret? We only get boy dogs because me and my daughter, we have a secret pact that dad doesn't know. Boys get more attached to the girls of the house and vice versa. Daddy's girl, mama's boy. I love my dad and my brother-in-law. So she was like forget about my innocence. She's probably going to love more Mike than I, but we live in an apartment. I know, I want him. I'm watching his video. These breeders have kids too? Yeah. That's good. Look how cute this puppy is. He's so calm. Yeah. Yes, listen, it's also a golden retriever. So they're like the sweetest dogs on the planet. The breeder does have young and older children. Do you see he's playing with the baby? I'm so different from another dog than another kid. That's so weird to think because every kid saw her and it's like all the time when we're walking, want to touch her and she looked at me like I don't want to be touched. This is the best video ever. I'm like so distracted by this little baby and the puppy together. Yeah. He's adorable. And Rosie is like super pretty too. Yeah. I think he's going to be like an amazing, like pretty dog, you know? You can tell from his face. I'm going to see. Yeah, we'd love to see a video of Rosie. I know. Just because it's a weekend, I don't know if we'll be able to get one uploaded. Yeah, but nothing's going to happen today. Definitely about to see. Oh, I see. He's so cute. So this is basically the environment that both puppies are living in. That's great. They're big. So for Rosie, like next week, for example, we get some answer and we decide to go ahead for Rosie. So what's the steps? Like how long time would it take for her to be here? It takes about two to three weeks to arrange for travel from Indiana. I'm assuming you're in the Orlando area. No, we are in South Florida. We are in Sarawak Beach. Okay. I'm in Fort Lauderdale. I know exactly where you are. I know where Delaware is. So the travel team is going to determine if the puppy is being driven or flown. And they're going to give you the travel date, usually within about seven to 10 days or sooner and figure two to three weeks tops before the puppy's home. She'll have all of her vaccinations up to date. You get a copy of it. And before she leaves her breeder, she has to have a full health evaluation done. So the breeder's vet's going to check, you know, heart, lungs, joints, fecal exams, her genitalia, body condition, and our health team's going to review it to make sure that she's perfect. And if there's anything on there, we're going to have to notify you before she's allowed to leave. That's great. Yeah, it's good to know. I mean, if we decide to go for a youngest, like doesn't make too many different because the youngest you have to have the vaccines and everything. Yeah. Yeah. They usually don't come home before eight weeks anyway. So even if the puppy is like, say seven weeks, it'll be two to three weeks from the eight week birthday. Yeah. So we were also looking at another one named Weezy. She's like eight weeks right now. She's a golden retriever puppy. So she'd be about like 10 or 11 weeks by the time we get her. We were to get her. Do you have her number? Yeah, I do. Let me just change here. Her number is 733208. Aw, cute. Very cute. The father's also a therapy dog, by the way. That's nice. Mm-hmm. And they're both in Indiana. So, again, I would say that it's a little bit different for Weezy. She's a little bit bigger. She's a little bit smaller. And she's only seven to eight pounds right now. So it would be two to three weeks from the 9th of May. And, again, it could be sooner. I'd rather not say sooner. Because if it's not, you'll be mad at me. Yeah. I know. Yeah. I personally think like Rose is like greatest. And I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, her bladder is going to be stronger, too. You know? What? Her bladder is going to be stronger than a nine, 10-week-old puppy. Yeah. That's a good thing. Can you repeat again? Her what? Her bladder. She'll be able to hold it in better than a younger puppy. And we can apply when we receive like $300 off. So when we go buy the dog, we can apply this discount. You got an e-mail with a promotion code? Yes. Yes. It's a promotion. Yep, as long as she's available. You said you have to get something? You have to ask your landlord if you can have a puppy? Was that what you were saying? Sorry. We can have a dog here. Okay. Yeah, just like we fill it up. We live in a pet-friendly place, yeah. Okay, perfect. Yeah, so it's up to you if you, you know, when and if you decide to move forward, as long as the puppy is available. And as soon as I can get a video, I will. I don't know if I'll have it before Monday. If you, when you receive, you can like send to us, it'd be perfect. Yeah, of course. Of course. All right. Okay. So, yeah, we get to talk a little bit, discuss a little bit, and we can go back to you maybe next week. Again, if she's still available, you know, the puppy will find home pretty quickly. All right. I know, I saw a lot of in the website, they read it's not available. Yeah. Yep. But if she's not available, we'll find another one. Talking about and figure it out. You got it. All right. Thank you very much for everything. You're welcome. And what is your number? So if you call, well, actually, if you call from, here, I'll do something different. I'm emailing you. You can email me back if you have any additional questions. It's probably the best way to get a hold of me. Okay? All right. That's great. All right. Perfect. Here, I just sent you an email. My name is Lisa. Oh, Lisa. All right. Thank you very much, Lisa. You're welcome. Perfect. I'll talk to you guys soon. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

"Hi, it's Lisa from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? Hey, Lisa, Gary Taylor. I spoke with you within the last couple hours regarding Juno. Yes. My wife just landed in Dallas and I talked to her and she said to go ahead with it. Oh, perfect. Let me make sure it's me that put the puppy on hold. I think so. That was... Yeah, I did put the puppy on hold. Oh my gosh. Okay. I'm just looking. It said reserved. Oh my gosh. I'm just double checking it's me. Give me a moment. I'm just tired of looking. What is your address, Gary? While I'm double checking, I'm going to tell you the total. Okay. It's PO Box 1884, Mammoth Lakes, California. And the nearest airport would be Reno, Nevada. Okay. The travel team, they have 17 years experience. They're going to see based off your address, but I'm going to take also your... This is your billing address, I'm assuming. That's correct. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to take your other address, your home address as well. The home address is 935... I'm sorry. 935... 46. That's for the PO Box. That's correct. Yep. Okay. Give me just one sec. We use a security company called Bolt. So thank you for giving me your billing address because some people don't and then the payment gets flagged by security. Oh, did I not mention my billing address is different? So you saved me the trouble of asking. All right. Give me a sec. What is your home address? 100 Ski Trail. City? Unit 14. Oh, sorry. City? City is Mammoth Lakes, M-A-M-M-O-T-H, Lakes, California. Say that again? 93546. Okay. Thank you. United States, California. Now I'm going to correct how I spelled Mammoth on your billing address. M-A-M-M-O-T-H. I had a U in there. Correct. Yep. I'm going to get that U out. Okay. I did put the PESC unhold for you. Oh, that's so special. I really appreciate that. No problem. Did I? Didn't I? I think I did. I did. And I wasn't going to because you said you'd call me tomorrow because that's what I wrote in my notes, but I left her unhold. And I'm glad my wife finally contacted me when she got to Dallas. I said, I want this and I want to get it. If it goes away, it's a bummer. Yeah, true. Okay. So we're going to do the chaperone, right? So let me tell you what the title is going to be. So with the travel, the taxes, oh, your taxes aren't bad. Seven and three quarters. Well, for California, it's not bad. Yeah. It could be worse. Activation of a chip for the rest of her life, a puppy pack, which has all the accessories she needs, her vaccination records and 10 years against the congenital and hereditary conditions. And the nanny is sixty five, ninety three and twenty two cents. So as soon as she reaches her weight that she should be to travel, which is two pounds, if she doesn't reach that weight, she has to wait. And the nanny does have with them NutraCal. Are you familiar with what NutraCal is? Yes, I am. OK, good, because you had a little one. You have to make sure that you go down. Yeah. OK, I'm emailing you the invoice. I'm going to go over some details with you first. OK. OK. Everything's in writing. I just sent it to your your email that I have the nineteen fifty nine is that associated with your bank account? Yes, it is. OK, perfect. OK, so I'm going to go through some questions. You ready? They're easy. Yes. OK. You've had this breed before, right? Yes. Everybody tell me why you're looking for a new one. Yep. And where you live is an apartment or condo townhouse. It's a townhome. Yeah. OK. Obviously, both of you are on board and not allergic to dogs. Correct. OK, good. And you know that Juno is not going to be housebroken. I should hope that you know that. Good. That is your job. We spoke about that a little bit. So be familiar with pad training, but she's going to a new environment and the older she gets, you know, the more she'll learn as well. I can't make any promises about full grown weight and color. They can change. Our breeders are breeding for health. So whatever she'll be, we're going to love her regardless. She won't be a hundred and twenty pounds, though. OK. Yeah. My own dog, Dead, who is from puppy spot. So I use him as my example. But he's a German Shepherd. So different. Yeah. I still don't think he'd be this big, but it's more to love. And of course, her puppies are supposed to be going to happy homes. We do expect her to be spayed whenever your vet recommends. You're OK with that, right? Absolutely. Yes. Good. And do you have a veterinarian already? We do. Oh, wonderful. So once you get her tentative travel date, which you'll have within about seven to ten days from now from our puppy manager team, try to make an appointment a few days later for a wellness check because she'll come home with all of her records, making sure she's perfect. And also the final health exam report, if there's anything on there at all, we have to notify you. So if you're not comfortable moving forward, you don't. You can either get a full refund or put the money towards a different puppy. However, if she's going to be if you change your mind before she comes home and it's not health related, there is a four hundred and ninety five dollar cancellation fee that goes back to her and she will go. The breeder has her here till June 8th. So figure two to three weeks or sooner from that date. OK. OK. OK. Perfect. Once we get the travel date and everything's booked, please try not to change it because the airline will charge us two hundred dollars, which we're going to ask you for. OK. OK. So you'll get again, you'll get a tentative date within seven to ten days from now. I'll send you an email also to recap what we talked about. And usually about 72 hours prior to the date, the puppy manager team is going to give you all the details you need. You'll have contact with the puppy chaperone as well. She'll come in a soft sided carrier that you get to keep and they'll give you all the health records and the sample of food that she's eating. OK. In addition to that, you'll get updates of new pictures and videos as she grows. The breeders usually do it every two weeks. These were a few hours ago. Yeah. So you'll wait a little bit. And if we can ask for a video in between, if she gets a little bit bigger, just so she's doing something, we'll get that to you as well. All right. That'd be great. Yep. Do you have any questions? The courier, we meet them at the airport, correct? Correct. They'll tell you which airport. So if the closest major airport to you means that the chaperone has to have like three or four layovers, they may not choose that airport. OK. They're going to choose the airport that's going to be the most convenient for the puppy to be in transit the least amount of time. So that would be a reason why it wouldn't be that airport. I don't know if it will. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, it should be fine. I mean, the puppy's coming from South Florida. So it is a really big international hub down here, too. So they usually fly into larger airports because there's just more flights coming in and out. That makes sense. OK. Yep. OK. Perfect. So go to the email that I sent you. We're about to make it official. It should say Juno is coming home. Oh, my goodness. I know. We're making it like a super official. And I'm going to text you also a bunch of resources. This three one six three, which zero three one six is yourself. That's correct. OK. So on this link, I'm about to text you, you'll see there there's offers for fetch health insurance. You get discounts with that discounts for Chewy. There is virtual pet training with discounts. There's a lot of really fun things on there as well. We do expect you to take out health insurance. Yes. And not to have it. And they work. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the poster child for that, too. So make sure I send it to the right phone number. Yeah, I didn't even email. Oh, it's G.T.W.I.Z. nineteen fifty nine at Yahoo. That's correct. Yep. Having issues with that email. Did you want to check your junk? Maybe it went there. If not, I can text it to. It's not junk either. That's weird. Did I send it? I did. G.T.W.I.Z. one nine five nine at Yahoo.com. I think we were having issues. I saw in our I.T. like channel that people are talking that some people weren't getting it. But I'm texting it to you. We're going to make sure I have the correct email. I'm getting some text. Let me get it for me. OK. I sent you three of them. Yeah, I did receive text. The last text. Just open that one if you can. Do you see the invoice now? Your puppy. OK, I can see it now. And the email that's on there, is it correct? It is, yes. Technical trouble. Sorry about that. Don't be sorry. It's fine. Technology always works perfectly every single time. Yeah. Just like if you read something online, it has to be true. I saw it says you had free puppies. No. No. All right. You'll confirm that and I will get an email as soon as it comes through. Now it says check out. And enter my credit card information. Correct. Whatever card gives you the most points. Yeah, absolutely. That's always the way to do it. Does Barbara have a name picked out yet? Not sure. I don't think so. We've been kind of thinking about it. But then again, it doesn't really make sense until you see the pup and it usually comes pretty quickly. Yep, I agree. And it'll show up in your statement as puppy spot group. Okay. I just hit pay and. You should get an offer for fetch as soon as you hit pay. I was going to ask you to check the box if you haven't already done so. Oh, okay. I agree. Yep. Sweet. It looks like it's done. Well, congratulations. You got a puppy. You did it. Yeah. Thank you. And I so much appreciate your time. You've been wonderful to work with. And if any questions arise in the next couple of weeks, is the number I just called you on the best way to reach you? Do you have a yeah, you can use that number and that'll take you directly to the puppy manager team who take over and I'm going to email you a recap and you'll have their direct emails as well. In case you forget anything. Alrighty. Sounds good. All right. Congratulations again, Gary and send Barbara my thanks so much for your time. All right. Pleasure. Bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Gary Taylor purchased a puppy named Juno from Puppy Spot. The representative, Lisa, helped him with the purchase and provided details about the travel arrangements and puppy care.

What questions do you have about these puppies? No, I know all about teacup poodles. But I want to purchase one. So which one would you like to purchase? Do you know which one would you like to purchase already or you don't? I don't really, I didn't look at your site. I just want to find out if you have any female ones. Let's see here. Have you had teacup poodles before? I had two. I have a black and white and they're sisters. But it is divorced. My ex-wife got them. Gotcha. Okay, let's see here.

There's a lot on our site, a lot. So it pretty much depends on, do you have any preference when it comes to looks? Like any specific color that you want her to be? What color, Dan? Any specific color? Like there's a few that are, there's a blue pearl color, a red one, and like a lighter cream. My two teacup poodles now, one is pure black and one is pure white. But I don't really care as long as they are good and healthy. Yeah they are healthy. They come with a health certificate as well. So yeah, it pretty much comes down to you selecting the puppy. Any specific questions you have for me? Now you're located in America? No these puppies come from all over the US. So it depends on where the breeder is. Let's see here. Most of the toy poodles are in Indiana, Texas, Missouri. Most of them are in Indiana. You are a puppy mill? No, we are not a puppy mill. Absolutely not. We work with breeders. I'm not going to pay that kind of money and have it come from a puppy mill. Like I said, we do not work with puppy mills. So if you'd like to take a look at our puppies, I would suggest you go to our website. And you're going to see a directory of all the different types of puppies. And what is the one you like?

Take a look at those puppies and once you know which one you want, give us a call and we'll help you out. So, I can't go to a place where you live and see them? No, you wouldn't be able to. I mean, even if you were in the same state, you wouldn't be able to see them before you purchase them. You can see images and videos and we can send you media of the puppies. We can certify when it comes to the health and the work that we do, but you wouldn't be able to see them beforehand, no. Well, if this is a puppy, no, I'm not interested.

She could come to you in the next two to three weeks. Okay. And so do you ship them? Do you drive them? How are you getting them to us? Well, we do place around 1,500 to 1,800 puppies per month, Vicki. We do have 18 years of experience. We only work with the very best breeders in America. And the puppy would either travel on ground transportation or on a pet-friendly airline, American Airlines. The cost of the travel on all of our puppies is a flat fee of $711. Okay. So does it go to the house? Do we pick it up somewhere? It says close to your home. So it will be close to your home. There will be other puppies that will be coming to the same area. So my puppy management team and travel department will get in touch with you within seven to 10 days to go over the travel date and the pickup location. Okay. All right. And so are the puppies trained at all? I know they're only nine weeks old. Yes. Well, I can tell you that Maple wouldn't be coming to you for two to three weeks. Now little Maple is started going potty outside. So that'll be started for you before coming. But the puppies are never fully trained, naturally potty trained until they get used to your home and your environment. Okay. So here's our situation. My husband and I live in California. My mother, who I'm buying the dog for, lives in Prescott, Arizona. And we are traveling to see her in June for three weeks. Is there a way I can have the puppy delivered while we are there? So I can get mom set up with the dog. You want the puppy to come in June? Yeah. No. There's no way. The puppy would have to travel in the next two to three weeks. Okay. So that would put us into May. Okay. Puppy would come the second or third week in May. In May. Okay. That's not too far off. And we would have a date for when it would come? Oh, yes. Most definitely. My puppy management and travel department, they are excellent. They are wonderful. They reach out to you within seven to ten days to go over that travel date. Okay. So I'll need to talk to my mom about that. I guess our other option is to wait and look for another dog closer to the time that we're going to be there, which would be another month from that delivery date. So is that possible? Well, we can definitely look at little Havapoos that are only three or four weeks of age. That way it would put that delivery date about what you're looking at. Okay. Yeah. Do you have any? Let's take a look. Let's bring up all the little Havapoo females. Doing that now. Okay. I'm going to put you on the, how would I look at what you're looking at? Go to puppyspot.com. Okay. And once you're there, you'll select Havapoo. Coming up, search for breeds. Okay. Havapoo. Okay. Results. You would go ahead and select female. And it looks like the little Havapoos are all older. All the little girls. Ten weeks, seven weeks, seven weeks. The seven-week-olds could come the first week of June, and that would be the two, there's Pippi and Kona. Do you see Pippi and Kona? I do. Uh-huh. They could arrive the first week of June. Okay. Okay. Is there a way I can call you back? I need to talk to my mom. For sure. Let me send you a quick text message. Do you text message, Vicki? I do. Oh, perfect. Then you can just text me back and say, David, give me a call. Okay. And I'll give you a call. Sound good? David. Okay. Got it. Yeah. My name is David Timpson. I am a senior at the company. So, yeah. Simply send me a text. I'll be here for you, Vicki. Okay. Thank you so much. Oh, you're very welcome. Thank you, guys. Okay.

"Hi, it's Lisa from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? Hi, Lisa. My name is Gary Taylor, and I reached out for some information on a puppy called Juno, and Rachel called me back, and she asked me to give her a shout if she's available, or I don't know if you could help me. Let me see. I don't think I'm looking. She's not available, but I'd be happy to help. Okay. What's the puppy ID number, or did you call in from a different number? Let me look for the puppy ID. 733835. Aw. The little chihuahua? Yes. Cute. I'm sorry, Gary. What did you say your last name was? Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R. Okay. What state do you live in? I live in California. Are you familiar with Puppy Spot, or is this the first time on the site? First time on your site. Okay. We're a network of private breeders across the country, and for the past 17 years, we've been screening and vetting every single one of them, so these are the top 10% in the industry. Juno would be coming home from her breeder in Florida, actually. Florida, okay. So dad is super small, 3 1⁄2 to 4 pounds, and mom is 6 to 7. When was Juno added? Today. She was just put on the site about five hours ago. Okay. And she's one of two in her litter. Okay. Her sister... Oh, she's the only... There were two in the litter, but they only posted one so far. Is this your first chihuahua? No, it's not. Unfortunately, we had to put a 14-year-old down about a month ago, and it was the most brutal thing I've ever done. Ouch. Afterwards, I was telling my wife, I said, I can't go through that again, and two days later, we both said we need another puppy. Famous last words. Yeah. Everybody says the same thing, me included. It's harder sometimes not having them than losing them. Yeah. Well, you know what I mean. Unfortunately, I owned an equestrian center. I put down several dogs and a dozen horses, but this little chihuahua is the most brutal thing I've ever been through. It was just so special because she was so small. We could take her everywhere with us, and that's what we're looking for is another little buddy we could take anywhere we want to go. So, Juno's expected adult weight would be... I mean... I would say five, six pounds, approximately. Okay. Perfect. No guarantee, of course. Our breeders breed for health and temperament, not size, and she's one of many on the site. How would I go about getting a short video clip of her playing or something? Is that something you want? I can request one. Sometimes it takes a couple of days. Yeah. But let me see something. Did you look at any of the other puppies? I did. This one, I'm looking for a short-haired female, and this one is just adorable. I've been looking for... My wife and I have both been looking for about the last 10 days, and this one just really caught my eye and just looks super special. Aw. So, I can see if there's a video that they haven't posted yet, but sometimes it can take a couple of days. Sometimes they can also get taken while we're waiting, unfortunately. Right. That happens, too. Where in Florida would this be picked up, and what major airport? Probably South Florida, probably Miami, but we can arrange for travel to you, unless you want to go pick her up. Yeah, travel to us might be better, but I can look at that. Because she's so little, I would recommend a nanny to fly with her. So, the nanny fee is an additional... I think it's 1983 or 87. I don't know why I have a block on that price. If you pick up, you go down to South Florida, you can pick her up as soon as she turns eight weeks, as long as she's two pounds. But she's not going to be available until after June, because she's four weeks old. Right. And currently, 16 to 20 ounces. Yep. My wife's in the air right now, coming back from Raleigh, North Carolina, so she won't be home until midday tomorrow. What deposit would be required if we wanted to hold her? I can put... Well, there's no deposits to hold them to full payment. I can put a puppy on hold for two hours, but that's pretty much it. I know your wife's in the air. She won't be home until about noon tomorrow. Yeah. No one really says that they're not interested after seeing a video, but quite honestly, at 16 ounces, she's not going to be doing much in a video. Right. That's probably why there isn't one. Rolling around. Yeah, it'll be like a picture. Okay. Sometimes it backfires on the breeders if they post them too early, but she's coming from a home with older children. This breeder's been with us for years, literally years. I'm trying to see what other notes I have on here. Let me see. She's priced a lot better than some of the others. Some of the teeny tiny ones can be upwards of $5,000. Right. Well, after the travel, it will be. Yep. But before she leaves her breeder, she'll have a full health evaluation done, literally nose to tail. The breeder's vet have checklists. They look at her heart, lungs, joints, fecal exam, genitalia, her body condition. They're going to check her teeth alignment. They check everything, make sure she doesn't have an open font, which some of them do. Like babies, they have a little soft spot that sometimes can close. Our health team has to review the report because we give you 10 years against congenital and hereditary conditions. That's fantastic. Are they typically pad trained? At this age, yes, but eventually they'll go out on the grass. Right. Now they're pad trained. They live in snow country, and if they have a start on pads, it just makes it easier during the winters. This year, we got 700 inches of snow. We live in a resort town. 700 inches? Yes. Very different from her South Florida. Yeah. Yeah. The breeder, she literally wrote in the notes that they're potty pad training. Again, at four weeks old, she's not really doing anything. She's just starting to wean off her mama. If we deliver a figure two to three weeks from the 8th of June or sooner, she just has to meet that weight requirement for the chaperone two pounds, or if you pick her up, you can pick her up a week after the 8th, again, as long as she met her weight requirement. The main thing is hypoglycemia with these little babies. We don't want their blood sugar to drop. There is regular transportation without a nanny. I wouldn't recommend it for a chihuahua flying from one end of the country to the other. I hear you. Yeah. If she was in Utah or somewhere closer, I don't know why I said Utah, but anywhere closer. The last one I got from Idaho and we flew her here, that's only an hour and a half flight. Right. Right. South Florida is, you couldn't get further away if you tried. Could I get your name again? Of course. My name is Lisa. Okay. What is your email? I'm trying to attach both accounts because I don't have the other one in front of me for some reason. Okay. I signed up. When I looked at this and asked for more information, I became a member of Puppy Spot. My email is gtwiz1959 at yahoo.com. I'm wondering if you used a different phone number when you signed up. I'm calling from my work phone. That's maybe why it didn't come through with my number. Which are the calls? My cell phone is 760-914-0316. Got it. Let's see. Maybe that's what's causing the confusion. Sorry to ask you for your information again. I just don't have it. No, that's totally fine. Yep, there you are. Gotcha. And you haven't spoken to Rachel yet, correct? No, she left me a voicemail and I tried calling back and got a hold of you. Gotcha. All right, perfect. Which is totally fine. I'm very interested, but a two-hour hold is not going to do me any good. I know. That's fine. We'll just have to take our chance and cross our fingers and hope she lasts for another 20 hours. If she's meant to be, she will be. Yep, I hear you. For sure. When did you see her? Your wife saw her before she flew? I sent her a screenshot and she was already in the air, so she hasn't seen her yet. But she has a layover in Dallas, so I'm sure I'll be hearing from her shortly. Okay, well, you can reach me any time. I'm going to shoot you a text to the 914 number. Uh-huh. And if you have questions, if your wife has any questions, you could always let me know. Did you leave your wife's phone number on the other account as well or not? I did not, no. Okay. If you want, I could take it down this way if she happens to call in. She doesn't have to start from the beginning again. Yeah, sure. 760-914-3163. And her name is Barbara Taylor. Okay. All right. You caught her just as she got onto the website, huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right, perfect. Let me just save all this. Well, you can reach me any time. I'm going to email you a link also back to the puppy so it will be easier to find her. And if any other puppies happen to just pop up now, maybe a littermate of hers, I'll send you that too so you have options just in case. Absolutely. I so much appreciate your time, and you've been extremely helpful. And thank you so much, and I hope to talk to you shortly. Pleasure is mine. I'm your personal puppy concierge. That's my job to help. Okay, thanks much, Lisa. All right. All right, Gary. Bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': ""Gary Taylor inquired about a chihuahua puppy named Juno and asked for information on her.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. Yeah, hi. I'm sorry. I walked away from my own phone. I was just calling to inquire about who you are and what you do, and I'm looking for a puppy. Okay. Have you looked at our website at all? I did. I was looking at – we're looking for a little female Yorkie. I saw a picture of Nina in there. Adorable little thing. Okay. Let's see. We previously owned Yorkies. We lost our Yorkie three years ago. She was 13 years old. Oh, wow. It's been some time for you then. Yeah. So now we're in California, central California. I've been online for several days, and I've talked to different people going to sites where they have really inexpensive dogs. You find out it's just a load of hooey. You're one of the first persons I can talk to. I'm an older guy. I want to talk to somebody and see if they're wearing their pants the right way before I change money with them. That's just how I am. Well, no. What's good is that you called the right person or you're talking to the right person because I live in California. Sounds like you're talking to the right person. Yes. I will tell anybody, and I tell my customers this all the time when they're talking about scams specifically. I was like, oh, I live in Scam Central. I live in California. I live in California. I live in Silicon Valley. I live in the mecca of scams. Where exactly do you live? I live in Brentwood. Okay. You probably don't. I live in a little town called Lebec. Most people know it as Fraser Park. Okay. I'm right on the LA line with Kern County. We're in the mountains here. Oh, nice. Nice. I don't know. I like the mountains. California is beautiful. We do have mountains. We do have countryside. We do. You said that you're looking at Nina. I see Nina. Nini? Nini. That's a cute little female. I think she was 12 weeks. Talk to me about what female Yorkies you have. I do have female Yorkies. I have 11 available right now. How does one receive a dog? Do you ship? I'm not going to pay for it. We ground transport. Good. We actually work with Premier Pet Transport, which is a third party. I know people are like, whatever. But they've been in the business for 20 years and they know the route of traveling a puppy or any dog of any size of any breed the proper way. Because we are U.S. licensed. So we do follow all of U.S. licensed regulations and all federal regulations when it comes to traveling our puppies. So they do have to meet the minimum requirement of two and a half pounds in eight weeks to travel. So you have 12 of them now, you say, that meet that requirement? I would say I have one, two. I have six available. So, yeah, a few of them. Could you e-mail the pics or info? Yeah. My e-mail address is nix.zone. You're talking about regulations. I know all about jumping through hoops and regulations. I'm older. I just retired. Nix.zone at hotmail.com. You've probably received something from that e-mail. I'm going to call this person. I've got to talk to people. I'm not buying it online. No, no, no. That's how California people are. So don't worry. I'm not buying it online. I'm not buying it online. I'm not buying it online. And nowadays I feel like you do. You have to talk to a physical body. I don't want that. Okay. So you said nix.zone at hotmail.com. Yeah, that's right. I actually was looking at a site in North Carolina that had Yorkies for sale for 750 and 150 for a client. And one of the payments was gift certificates. I was like, get out of Dodge. That's a scam from the top. Receiving gift certificates for dogs. You've got to put on a plane for a third of what they're valued. Isn't that funny? Are you serious? I am serious. I'm absolutely serious. It was called ñ if I e-mail with you, I'll find the name and send you the name. I'll send you the name that was online. I shouldn't be laughing. No, it's funny. It's ridiculous. But, you know. But, anyhow. Yeah, let me look at these dogs. And obviously if you could include the price, I've got to tell you straight up, I can't afford a $5,000 dog. I just can't. And those lovely little breeds. What are the white and brown and black ones? They're just so adorable. They're so darn expensive. We had a selkie before. Okay. What are the little white and black and brown Yorkies? They're white, black and brown. Yeah, I saw them on your site. They have little white fuzzy marks. Because we have so many mixed breeds, that could be anything. Yeah, I was going to say, this is some kind of a mixed breed. Yeah. What's a Morkie? Oh, a Morkie. Oh, those are super cute. So, they're a Maltese and a Yorkie together. That's where the white comes from. They're super cute. They look like little teddy bears. At least the way you trim them, usually. They usually trim them like little teddy bears. They're adorable, but I can't afford one. They're like five grand and up, I believe. Right? Unless you can find one for less than three. Or around three. Do you have any more keys? I know that breed. Let me back up for a minute. I want to surprise my wife with a new dog. Okay. He said, let me back up a little bit. I'm going to explain everything. I love it. I love it. I really want to surprise her. She's been a little low lately. I know this new dog will just give her a new mission. We see that. I know the breed you're talking about. Every once in a while we see that Morkie. She loves that little thing, too. She misses her Yorkie dearly, I can tell. That was her lap dog. She works out of the house. She sits at her computer with a little dog in her. She does all that. Okay. What I'm going to do. We need to get a dog back on her lap. I'm going to break your heart. I'm going to send you four of these Morkies. They are all under three. If you take out one of these Morkies, I will give you an additional $300 off. You have to deal. I'm going to go look. I'm going to go look. I'm going to go look. I'm going to go look. I'm going to go look. We need a dog on this woman's lap badly. I think I found the right person today. You. I love surprises. Oh, my goodness. I love husbands like you. They make decisions for their wives. They are like, nope, I'm getting, she is low, I'm buying her a dog. What? I love you. Every ten days she will say, I want to get a new Yorkie one day. I'm going to get a dog. Her name was Zoe. I said, well, keep it down. I decided, I'm going to get her a damn dog. No more wishing we are going to get a dog. Let me go in and have a look. I'm outside so she doesn't discover what I'm up to. I'm outside so she doesn't discover what I'm up to. I'm going to hang up and go inside. Do I need to call you back or do you need to call me back? Do I need to call you back or do you need to call me back? No, you can either e-mail me back and let me know, like, hey, out of these, I sent you four Morkies. out of these, I sent you four on each one. You can just let me know which one you like out of all of them. I'm going to love them all. I'm going to get my son to shadow up with me. You guys don't know which one. My son will probably know before I do. You guys don't know which one. That way I can send you pictures of the parents and then whatever background information you want on the puppy. Okay. No, I'll know when I see the dog. I've been an animal person my whole life. I grew up on a farm. I can know everything about animals except for looking in their eyes. I'll know from these photographs. Okay. Okay? Alright. That's good. As my father said, my father the farmer used to say, you can tell when an animal is smiling, and you can. I love the word. I like that. Okay. Your dad was a wise man. Yeah, he was. He was very wise. I'm going to email you. Sometime in the next half hour. Okay? Okay. Sounds good. Good. Thank you. Your name? Crystal. Crystal. Okay. My wife's name is Christine. That's easy. Thank you, Crystal. I'll get back to you. Bye. Okay. Bye-bye.

Sure, yeah. So Bella is three months. She'd be coming to you from Indiana near Fort Wayne. She's priced at $2,799 plus tax. She'll come with all of her shots, vaccinations, and deworming up to date. Have you owned golden retrievers before? Yes. Okay, and what made you guys decide to get a puppy? So we haven't had one, like, a golden retriever for a while, and then I recently had to put down another dog that I had, so I'm kind of looking at options, like, what we can find. But we are familiar with the golden retrievers. All right, very good. Do you guys have small children in the home? Yes. Okay, wonderful. All right, excellent. Anybody have allergies to dogs or pet dander, anything like that? No, nothing. Okay. And you guys are calling from, I guess, the Chicago area? Yeah, we're in the northern Chicago area. Okay. So if you're wanting to get her, she'd be ready for pickup in about a week. So that's the process as far as how much time it takes to prepare her. We offer, you know, an option for you to pick up the puppy, or, you know, we do offer delivery to you. It's your choice. That's how you guys wanted to do it. Give me one second, okay? Bear with me, sorry. Yeah. Okay, you there? Becky? Yes, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you, yeah. Okay. So I was telling you the process. So if you guys want to get her, you pay for your puppy with either credit card, a debit card, or PayPal. We also offer financing through charity. Well, no, actually we don't have any financing available in Illinois. But you pay for the puppy securely. And then once you've paid for her, you pay through the website, and then we coordinate you picking up or, you know, delivery to you, whichever you can choose your preference when you do the order online. Okay. Can we come see her? By chance, is there any way that we could go see her before, you know, we purchase or is that not an option? It's not an option. Our breeders don't do that. The puppies are raised privately, and that would be too many people coming to play with the dog. Right, okay. We don't allow people in their home. No. No, I'll email you our process, and then if you guys want to proceed, just give me a call and let me know, and then we'll set it all up for you guys, okay? Yeah, if you could please send me the email, and then we're going to look at our options and then see what we can do, and then we'll move forward from there. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I'll have to be here.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about purchasing a golden retriever named Bella, asked for pricing and details, and inquired about seeing the puppy before purchase.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Slot. This is Candace. Can I help you? Hi, Candace. This is Nancy. I brought that dog yesterday. Yes. Hey, how are you? I'm doing fine. How are you? Yes. You did the financing and I sent you the information over to call the financing company. I already talked to the financing company. Perfect. All right. And what did you decide moving forward? Yes. Did you get your financing completed with them? The dog is $4,000. Yes. That's a lot of money. Okay. So... I want to know how soon I can get the dog. It's the same timeline for everyone. It's typically about two weeks. Sometimes it can be three. That's the quickest they're going to get there. You know, sometimes our travel will be a little bit quicker, but I would rather you be happy that your puppy is coming in earlier than the timeline that I provide. Right. So I always tell everybody two to three weeks, but if you get an earlier itinerary, that means you're going to be super excited. What are the chances of that? I don't know because I'm not the travel team. So the travel team plans the puppy's travel for us. We have a specific department that plans all the logistics of the puppy's travel. So I can talk to them and get my dog sooner? No. It goes just two to three weeks. You'll get your itinerary out for your puppy in about a week via email. So like if your itinerary shows an earlier date, then yay, right? Super exciting. So I send the account over to the travel team. They take a look and they plan the puppy's travel and then they send you an email with your puppy's itinerary information. Well, the finance company charged me $190 processing fee. I can't believe it. They're charging you what? $190 processing fee. Did you call and talk to them about their same as cash option? Their what? Did you call and talk to them about their if you pay it off early, the same as cash option? They said they have until August 6. To pay it off early? They said they have until August 6. So 120 days to pay same as cash. Okay, well that's good. That's what I thought they were. We have three different financing companies. $582 a month. And then they have no penalty if you pay it off within 120 days. Whatever yesterday to August 6 is. April, May, June, July, August, August 6, 1990. That's a little over. Sounds like that's about 100 and maybe 105 days. That ain't 120 days. I've looked at the calendar exactly to see. So. But yes, they do have that where you can just try to get it paid off as quickly as possible. But we I will tell you that we don't start that we don't start planning the puppies travel until the financing has been completed. Say that again. I said we won't start working on the puppies travel until the financing is completed. If someone's doing financing. My finances complete I think. Oh, you did complete it. Contract with him. Yeah, yeah. Oh, perfect. All right. So then the only thing you have to do. And pardon me if you hear any noise in the background stays actually my day off and my birthday. So we're actually at a beautiful little garden center getting some flowers for our yard. So if you hear the background, I sort of do it right now. I just poured on my calls to myself on my days off. I'm like, yeah, I'll call number. Your cell phone number then. So they'll send you an email in about a week. So in about a week, you're going to have an email from puppy spot and it's going to have her itinerary for when she's going to be going to Candace's address. So I'm sure you're going to go together. You said a picker pick up the puppy. So just watch out for that email to come to you in about seven days. And then our travel team usually calls all of our customers two to three days before your puppy's travel day, just to confirm with you and kind of give you just a nice friendly reminder. Like, hey, just remember your puppy is arriving three days from now. So you'll be picking them up at this time in this day. So they'll call you as well. So if you have everything wrapped up, then every is the only thing you have left to do was just sign in the financing. So if you got that completed, then you are good to go and everything is completed. And the only thing you have to do is just wait for that email to come to you in about a week. Okay, I got another question. Do you know how they how they come to the airport? But how do they put it? The dog in a crate or a box or how does that work? Right. So they're in a travel crate. If they go American Airlines, they have a designated pet area. It's a designated room for all live animals. It's temperature controlled. It's pressure rods controlled, just like it is for you and I when we fly. So that's if they go air. They could go ground transport as well because we do do ground transport also. Okay. So when you get your itinerary, it will let you know this is a date your puppy's travel on. This is a method and this is what time you need to pick up. Okay, all right. Well, thank you. Happy birthday. Absolutely. Oh, thank you. 4040. Whoo. I told my daughter, my daughter, she told me she said, Mommy, you can't say Lordy Lordy feel like I'm 40 anymore. She's like, because now you are I said, I know. Okay, thank you. And I'll send you a recap email over now that they're financing this complete. I will send you a recap later this afternoon. So be looking out for email that's going to come directly from me from Candace Bird. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Nancy. Bye bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer called to inquire about the status of their puppy purchase, financing, and travel arrangements.

I'm sorry, say that again. Have you owned a Cavapoo before? Is this your first time? No, I have not. I have not. We just lost a Maltese poodle mix. He was 11 1⁄2 years old, and he passed last month. And we are absolutely heartbroken, but we've got to march on. It's hard, though. Yes, I'm sorry. I understand. Yes. Do you have any other pets? Yes, we have a lab, a brown lab. She's 12. Okay. And she took care of that little poodle like she was the mother of them. Oh. And she's walking around like, what happened? Where is he? Right, yes, she's lost without him. Yes, she's lost without him. So I wanted to wait a few more months, but I think I'm going to go ahead and make the purchase. Get a puppy. Yes, because she's been moping around since he passed. Okay. Do you want me to put this puppy on hold for you? Pardon me? Do you want to reserve this puppy? You want me to put the puppy on hold for you? Yes. What are your methods of payment?

Yes, you pay in full, and you pay securely. We're a 17-year-old company, so, you know, we're verified. Okay.

"Hi Tracy, how are you? This is Candace from Puppy Spot. Hi, how are you today? Good. How How are you? Perfect. I'm good. Thank you for asking. So your account was just assigned to me a little bit ago, and so I was just going to follow up with you. I seen a text came in as well. I'm asking how do you reserve a dog? Yeah, and I had worked with Derek. I know, but this is like a group line. Which is fine. I told him I would call when we're ready, but... Yeah. Yeah, and let me see. He's not in today, and he... Yeah, he's off on Monday. Yeah, he's not in today, and I don't know why for some reason he didn't keep your account. I'm not sure why. I really can't say because I have a... No, he did. I just sent him a question the other day. I don't think I had logged into my account necessarily. Yeah, I can see the last time you talked, or the last time you all talked was three years ago, so I think the way... It's kind of odd to explain, but we can mark an account like done if we don't feel the customer's ready and they're going to wait a little while, so I don't know if that's what he did or what. I'm not sure, but since you did another inquiry in reference to grant today, then it basically reassigns it back out to someone that's actually in that can assist you and help you. Okay, well, I'm going to work with Derek, so I will wait until tomorrow and I will send him a note. Okay, yeah, absolutely. He's literally answered every single question I've had through this process. Yeah, absolutely. I will... So I feel kind of bad. Oh, no, we're all on the same page. I was just curious, too. You don't have to pay five or seven. Really, it was around... The only... Reserving is essentially buying it, right? Yes, that is correct. Okay, seven, seven. So once you go in and you check out with a puppy, that reserves the puppy directly to you. So if you go to the website and do it, it's either done through PayPal, credit card, or debit card, or we can send you an invoice and you can reserve that puppy as well. Those are the two ways that you can do it. But you have to pay for it in order to reserve it. Yes, so there's two ways. So sometimes when you see a reserve tag, it typically sometimes means one of three things. It either means a puppy concierge, our team here, so me, Derek, Sarah, Brenda, it means we put that puppy on a temporary two-hour hold because there's an invoice out pending on the puppy. If the puppy hasn't been purchased during that two-hour period, then our system will automatically put the puppy back onto our website. Or it could be because a customer paid a deposit down on the puppy and they still have their outstanding balance that they have to pay. So when you see a reserve tag, it's either one or the other. Okay, so is there a way online that I can just put a partial payment or no? No, unfortunately, you cannot do a partial payment online. So if you check out online, it will only let you do a pay in full only through PayPal, credit or debit. If you're going to do a partial payment, like if you're wanting to basically like split it up, I have customers who want to divide up their cards and put like half on this card and half on another card. Then we just have to send out the invoice to the customer's email addresses with whatever amount they're wanting to do on each card. Okay, all right. That way. Okay, all right. So that's how that works. So I can just wait. I just feel bad because I've been like, he was the person I've been talking to and I told, I said, you know, once we're ready. And he just answered questions on the dog a couple of days ago. Yeah, on the 27th. I don't know why he would have got rid of the account then. That's kind of, yeah. Did he get rid of it? I don't, well, I mean, that's the only way it gets. I don't know if he did because I had, I had the wrong, I had, um, when I went to, when I went to what I did tonight, it had my, it had the wrong phone number in there. So I'm wondering, he had my cell phone. So I don't know if he has me under something else. Let me see if you have a duplicate. Because he might have me without any info in there. Because I called. No, it's not. There's no duplicate for you. There's only this one. There's only this one account for you. And it has a 617-945-3758. And I can see Derek did have it. I can see that Derek just answered, uh, in general, multi-poos range between five to 20 pounds. I can see he answered that question for you on the 27th, which was three days ago. So like I said, our system, like the custom, like we can choose if we're going to keep an account or, you know, basically close the account until the customer's ready. So maybe he just, I don't know. I can't speak for him. He's a great guy, but I don't know what he did. I don't know if he went ahead and closed it or our system expires things as well. So if you go like, if you go three days, two days, 48 hours, and you haven't spoke to a customer who has an account, then our system will just automatically expire it out. And then if the customer like submits another inquiry, then it will basically reassign it to a puppy concierge that's available at that time. So, but, but that's fine. I will actually just sit. I know. I feel, I feel bad. Like, I mean, cause I'm, I mean, I'm fine either way, but like, I just, I don't know. Yeah, I know. If that's what you want to do, I absolutely, I don't have a problem doing that. Like I said, we're all a team. It's not a big deal with me at all. He's just. Yeah. I mean, I'm assuming you guys get like credits or something for it. We all share them. So like if he, if he's worked your account and then I've worked your account, him and I would share it. We do. So, and I'm just being honest. I'm not going to cover, try to be dishonest about that. So it would be shared between him and I. So, but he is not in today. I know he's out Sunday, Wednesdays. So as I say, I'm not sure his exact day's off, but I know that he's not in today. I did look and he's definitely not in today, but I don't mind him sending him a message and just letting him know that you would like him to follow up when he comes in tomorrow afternoon, because I think he comes in tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. So I will definitely have him reach out to you, but I'm just going to tell you because I don't want you to get upset with me if it does happen that I don't have any way to hold the puppy until he comes in tomorrow. So like if somebody else was to go on our website or call in, then it would go, then they would be able to get the puppy. So if you want to wait, I'm like I said, I'm perfectly fine. Yeah, I mean, and if I reserve it online anyway, then no one gets it. Like how does that work? If you go and do it online? Yeah. Oh, no, it's still divided between Derek and me since the account was assigned to both of us. Oh, okay, because now it's been assigned to you. So either. Okay. All right. Okay. That's I mean, there's other if it gets taken, it gets taken then. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Tracy, I will send him a message now and tell him to please follow up with you like ASAP when he comes in and tell him that you're ready to go. Okay. All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. All right.","{'Summary': 'The customer called to inquire about reserving a dog and to follow up on their account which was previously assigned to another representative.

"Thanks for calling Puppy Spot. My name is Fran. How may I help you? Hey, Fran. I'm calling on behalf of a friend of mine that lost her second Maltese. She's 16 and a half years old, and I think she's ready, and I found your site, and I just wanted to know where in Louisiana it costs and waits and just kind of how your program works, babe. Sure. And could I have just your first name, please? My first name is Bethann. Hi, Bethann. That's my cousin's name, and I don't know if I've ever met another Bethann. So, hi. Nice to meet you. So, Bethann, we are a nationally-based company, so our puppies are with their breeders in different areas of the country. So, depending on which puppy you are looking at, that would determine their location, although we could travel any puppy to you in Louisiana, no big deal. And so, you said your friend is... Would you guys be looking for another Maltese, then? Yes, she would be looking for another Maltese. Her last Maltese, when Tutu was her name, passed away, I think her highest weight was like four or five pounds. Of course, she passed away at almost 17 at two. So, she's just the best dog mama ever, and she's always been a one-person dog. The dog before that was precious and a little bit bigger of a Maltese, but she's just, you know, the dog has an outfit and a bow for everything. So, yeah, I'm just trying to help her. She's been actually, unfortunately, scammed a few times or attempted, you know, to try and say, give me a deposit, and then you can look at the dog, whatever. So, I'm just trying to find a reputable, you know, a company that can give her a forever home for a new baby. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, I would love to tell you about the Maltese that we have. So, it seems to me like our least costly Maltese is about 2,600, and when it comes to weight, that particular Maltese is about, you know, going to be about five to six pounds full grown. Our smallest Maltese full grown would just be a hair under five pounds, probably. Okay. And where is this one located? So, the one that I had just mentioned, she is currently with her breeder in Indiana. You know, we don't have any Maltese that are already in Louisiana. The closest would probably be Missouri or Texas that we have to Louisiana, but none that are already in Louisiana. We would, you know, travel the puppy to you. And you would travel the puppy to the person? Yeah, like if she purchased it, we would travel it to her. Yep. Okay, but they have to, of course, purchase it first, but I guess that's... Yeah, there are so many scams out there, so I don't blame you or her, of course. The one thing about us is, you know, we are accredited with the Better Business Bureau. We've been on Good Morning America, Fox and Friends, the Today Show, and we even partner with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to give their wish kids puppies. Also, we only accept payments via credit or debit card, somewhere where your bank knows exactly where your money is going, and a lot of scams will ask you to pay with a money transfer app like Zelle or Venmo or maybe like, you know, store-bought gift cards. And yeah, that's just not how we work. Right. No, I totally understand, and that's why I just have to ask the questions. So look, this dog in Indiana, what sex is it? A female. And what's the name that they've given it? Yeah, so if you look on our site, her name is Alta, A-L-T-A. Alta, I'm looking for her. How old is she now? So she's one of our older puppies. She was born in November, so she's about six months old. Oh, six months? Uh-huh. I think she'd want it a little younger. What about Texas? Is she in Texas? Yeah, well, we only have one Maltese in Texas, and it's a male. Male. Yep. I was looking for Alta, and I can't find her. It should be A-L-T-A. You can also search at the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner. So she's six months. What's the reason you've had her for so long? Honestly, I'm not really sure. Let me pull up her account. So it looks like she's actually been purchased twice, and both times the customer has canceled their purchase before she ever left the breeder's home. And honestly, we can send our puppies home as early as eight weeks. So once a puppy hits that 12-week mark, they start getting glossed over, and they don't really get as much attention as our younger puppies. Our customers want the shiny new baby puppies. So I think, honestly, just because she was taken off the website for a while because she had been purchased, and then they canceled. So she was put back on the website a little bit older. She was purchased and then put back on the website again. And so I think she's just had a tough time finding a home. Right. Yeah, go ahead. I think my problem was I was in Louisiana, so you say she's in Indiana because I'm in your search area. Yeah. Let's see. I don't know, anyway, you could email pictures or how does that work? Yeah, I can definitely email pictures. Bethanne, what's a good email address for you? Beth, B-E-T-H at, B as in Tom, E as in elephant, A as in apple, M as in Mary. B-E-T-H-A-N-N-E dot com. Okay, so Beth at team Bethanne dot com. Uh-huh. Okay, great. I will email her pictures over. What else can I help you with, Bethanne? I'm going to forward these straight to Vicki, my friend. Are you a good contact or she just needs to call the 1-800 number? How does that work? Yeah. She can definitely reach out to me. My name and number is at the bottom of the email, so she can definitely reach out to my email directly or my number is there so she can give me a call. That would be great. I appreciate it. I think talking about the age thing, that might even be better. So I'll look forward to that email and get that to her as soon as possible. Okay, that sounds great. I'll be here. Now, she would pay for the flight. How does that work? Yeah, so we would arrange everything so she doesn't have to worry about scheduling anything when it comes to the flight. However, the travel is the only cost not included in our website because we do give you the option to pick up the puppy. So if we travel the puppy to you, the travel cost is $711, $711. Okay. Before I hang up, I did get your email. Thank you so much. Can you tell me the weight of Alta? Yeah, yeah. So she at six months old, which she's starting to, you know, she probably won't get too, too much bigger. She was just weighed earlier this week and she's three and a half pounds. So she's really expected to be between five and six pounds full grown. She'll be a pretty small puppy. Okay. All right. Perfect. I will, I'll be in touch, Francesca. Thank you so much for answering my call. You got it. We'll talk with you soon. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye. All right. Happy traveling, guys.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquired about purchasing a Maltese puppy from Puppy Spot for her friend.

"Hello? Yes, hello? Hello? Can you hear me? I can hear you. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Doing well. This is Joyce, right? Yes. Awesome. Just was reaching out here from Puppy Spot. My name is Derek. In regards to the poodles that you were looking at, the mini poodles, just wanted to know if you were still interested in potentially bringing one home for the puppy. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. So let me just ask you, all right? All right. Yeah. My question was with regards to, right, from Taris, I'm sorry, I could not hear ads and we will be back. You know, when you looked at the scaring with the kids and so I was interested to know if you were interested. I am. I just wanted to know like how's the process work? I live in Michigan. Do you guys have finance? Do you guys have payment plans? Yeah. I'll shoot you over a text message so you can reach out to Terrace and you can see how much you get approved for to go towards the puppy here. Bear with me for a second. Let me just send that and then I'll go on. Okay. All right. Sending that now. So it's a very, very easy process here. So basically once you decide on the dog that you want here, we will place the dog on hold. I will send you an invoice to just cover the invoice, pay the dog, pay for the puppy, pay for the puppy's travel, only because, let me see exactly where the puppy is. So you're in Michigan. This puppy's in Indiana. I mean, are you willing to drive to Indiana or would you rather have the puppy travel to you? Travel to me. Sure. I'm willing to go there. So what we would do is we'd place the puppy on hold after I make sure that you are a good home and a good fit for this puppy, because I got to do our screening questions here as well. As long as I deem you guys fit for the puppy. From there, we will place the puppy on hold. You pay the invoice. Once the invoice is paid, the dog's officially yours. Within seven to 10 days of purchase, you're going to get a call from our travel department. They're going to let you know all details about travel, how the puppy's coming by ground or by air. Most of the time it is by air, but in a situation where Indiana is not so far from Michigan, there is definitely a chance it goes by ground. We don't go door to door anymore in terms of travel. So they would let you know. Usually it's like the largest international airport closest to you for pickup. Do you live like pretty close to one? Maybe about 30 to 40 minutes from the airport. Oh, that's not terrible. Yeah. So does she come with a pet nanny or no? That is an option in terms of travel. We do have a chaperone option for travel. It is a little bit more expensive than just having the puppy travel by itself. Now remember, the puppy's not truly traveling by itself. It is handled with a representative from American Airlines. It is the company that we work with, that we're partnered with, who specialize in puppy travel here. So yeah. Okay. Let me ask you this. Sure. So where does she travel at? Is she up under the plane or like- No, no. Okay. Good question. Yeah. The puppy's not like under the plane stowed with luggage by any means. The puppy's in an air controlled room on the plane to ensure full safety and comfortability of that puppy. Yeah. Dim lighting. It has everything the puppy needs. Yeah. American Airlines specializes in dog travel. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good question though, for sure. Yeah. And that would be my concern. I mean, she's already on an airplane by herself and coming with me into a new home. I just want her, I don't want her to be scared. Right. No, a hundred percent. We try to do everything to ensure the puppy's full comfortability and safety during transit here. Okay. Yeah. And then you would be able to receive the puppy within two to three weeks of purchase or from the puppy's availability date. Some of the puppies are totally available because they are over eight weeks. In this situation, the one that you were looking at last, I'm sure you were looking at a bunch of puppies, but Shannon, yeah, Shannon is like the good example. She is seven weeks old. In three days, she'll be eight weeks. So basically the whole process starts from the availability date. Okay. So it starts today, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Right. In this situation, the last one you looked at in three days, yes, it would be two to three week arrival within, you know, from three days from now. Okay. So how big is he estimated to get? That was my next question. Yeah, obviously it's not something that we can fully guarantee, but, you know, just based off of my professional experience, you know, with a parent being 10 to 12, the other one being eight to nine pounds, you figure, you know, as long as it does get proper diet and, you know, the right activity level in terms of, you know, exercise and whatnot, I'd say anywhere between like eight to 10 pounds. Okay. I just wanted, I wanted a puppy that's perfect because I wanted a puppy 20 pounds and under. I had a Maltese, Lucy Lou was her name. And she was like six pounds soaking wet. And when I tell you this was like the best dog I ever had in my life. I had her for 14 years and I put her down in September and I was just completely devastated. Like it happened in September, but I feel like it happened just yesterday. Right. I know it's never easy. I know. No, no, it's not. No. I can't look at her pictures, Diego. I know. I can't. Like I start, I can't look at her pictures. I can't. Right. I understand completely for sure. Yeah. So I was like, me, if I get like another little baby to love and spoil, I'll live alone. Just me. And my fiance, you know, he lives in his home. We live separately until we get married or whatever. Sure. He mainly would be with me. Cool. So, yeah. Yeah, no, that, that definitely works for sure. You know, I understand how hard it is to lose a puppy. I always say we're not here to, we're not here to replace your old puppy. You know, your old dog. We're here to add to the family. And I truly believe that, you know, if you gave that dog a great life, that dog would want you to get another puppy and, you know, provide that puppy with a great life as well. So yeah, it's just the way that I look at it for sure. But yeah, it's as easy, it's a very, very easy process in terms of like locking down a puppy. I think the hardest part is actually landing on a puppy, you know, one that works exactly for you because there are so many puppies on our website, really, really cute ones. So yeah, I would say, again, you know, when you do have a chance, really narrow down your search to like one or two puppies. We can do some, you know, contrasting on our next phone call. You know, I can explain like, you know, just through the, go through the application, ask you all those screening questions. But again, without you knowing exactly what puppy it or being within one or two, I would say, you know, really find the one that really catches your eye and, you know, take all the time you need and give us a call back and, you know, let's get you a puppy home. I know. So what's the deposit and how much, how long is, when I give the deposit off my debit or credit card, how long is she held for? So basically you can put down a deposit, a minimum of $500, anything over, you know, you can do of course, but it's a minimum of $500 and that puppy will be on hold for the next 72 hours from the time of purchase. So you'll have another three days, yeah, another three days to pay the remainder of the balance in order to lock down that puppy fully and start prepping the puppy for its forever home. Yes. Because that's what I'm doing now. I'm like doing a lot of prep. I just have to figure out what breed I want. Of course. That's definitely the first step is picking out the breed, then sifting through them all. And then, yeah, feel free to reach back at any time if you want to look together while you know, we're on the phone, you know, to kind of ask questions, we can do that. But yeah, feel free to reach back out at any time. Okay. I do have a question because I do want to nail down my first. I'm going to leave it tonight. How can I get like more pictures of her or like maybe like another good video of her just so I can see like her little body and her little face a little bit better? Right. I would say inquire with myself or one of my coworkers here. The only thing here with pictures, it gets a little tricky because a lot of these breeders are of Amish descent, so they don't use technology. So they have to hire admins to come in and do this for them. So again, I always tell people that it could take up to 72 hours before, you know, we get those extra pictures. So again, I never mind asking. I'll always ask for all of my clients. But the last thing I want is, you know, an extra picture or two to be the reason why, you know, you don't get the puppy because somebody else just said, I'm okay with these pictures and then purchased the puppy right underneath us. You know what I mean? So again, I don't mind asking and I will always ask. But again, I just like to let my clients know that because puppies fly off our website and people fall in love with these puppies and they're like, I need this puppy. I've looked for days and I finally found this one and 25 minutes later, the puppy sold. So just keep that in mind, of course, as well. That's why we try to do a good job of taking them off the site as soon as, or at least putting a banner on them saying, you know, they found a home where they're reserved just so nobody falls in love with these puppies. I know, because it's so easy to fall in love with these little things. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to look at the puppies tonight. Sure. Did you text me or did you email me just so I can email you back or text? I can shoot you a text message. Yeah. I think you just texted me too. I did. I did for the financing. Yes. You can text that number back at any time. Oh, what's the qualifications for the financing? I just thought about it. Okay. That's honestly up to, I don't really deal with them. I'm not exactly sure to be completely honest. Call them and speak with an agent or fill out the application online. They'll know way more than I do. Got it. Okay. All right. All right. Awesome. Take care. Thanks for your time. Bye.","{'Summary': 'The customer inquired about purchasing a mini poodle from Puppy Spot and asked about the process, financing options, and travel arrangements.

"We're calling PuppyFucks, Brad. How can I help you? Yeah, I'm calling on a puppy you have I saw online, or my daughter did. His name is Matt. He's got a number. Do I need to give that to you? Yeah, give me just one second here. See everything pulled up. All right, what's that puppy's ID number? It is 731097. Okay, yeah, I got Matt pulled up. What questions do you have on him? Is he a mix or is he a purebred? What is he? So unless we're talking like a designer breed where it's like a golden doodle or a labradoodle brought together for a specific reason, all of our puppies are going to be purebred. They are. Okay. All of them are. I had a what they call a doxil. Have you ever heard of them? A D-O-X-L-E. Have you heard of those dogs? I have. Okay, they're mixed with a, they're a dash hound and a beagle. Okay. I just had to put him down yesterday. So cute. But this guy looked like my little guy. So the purebred is so it was a dachshund. Is this a nickname for a dash hound or is a dash hound a different dog? It depends on how you pronounce it. It's so some people say dachshund, but it's actually pronounced dachshund. Okay, gotcha. Okay. So some of them I've noticed are big. The bigger ones are probably a mixed breed, right? Would you say? Well, no, I mean, there's different sized dachshunds. So for instance, Mac is a miniature smooth hair. So he's going to be low on the spectrum and there's going to be standard sized dachshunds as well. Okay, so he's going to be a small guy top the way to sit on there. What 10 to 12 pounds? 12 pound range is a pretty good understanding right between the parents. Okay. Okay. And where are you guys located? So we do not have a physical storefront. We specifically represent a network of verified data breeders throughout the US online. Okay. Okay. So where I'm in California. Where is he located? Let's take a look here. So Pup's going to be traveling to out of Indiana. You cut out. Oh, I apologize. Yeah. So Pup is going to travel to out of Indiana. Indiana. Okay. Now the price I noticed was $3,600. That is the base price of the Pup. So I mean, everything said and done health care tax travel, we're probably sitting right about $4,700. Wow. So they're expensive dogs when they're purebred. Our puppies across the board are going to start at bare minimum $3,500 and up. So have we ever had the cheapest puppies? No. Will we? Absolutely not. We spend a lot of time and money investing in the Pup, consistently physically going and evaluating the breeders. There's just a lot of work that we go through. So you know exactly what's coming home, which is also why you're going to be putting your health commitment in the first place. Right. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. That sounds good. He sounds like he looks like a cutest little guy in the world. Right? Yeah. No. Absolutely no health issues, hereditary wise. No cosmetic issues. Yeah. I mean, Pup is sitting exactly where we want to see them sitting. And he's a male, right? Yep. Absolutely. Is your name Russell? Russell Romero? Yes. Okay. So my daughter, I think emailed you guys. Honestly, I was just trying to pull up the account under your name. There's nothing there. But yeah, so yeah, I mean, we just go through a lot of work with the Pups. We don't work with any and every breeder out there because we're very, very quick with work. I'm not going to risk everything we've built over the past 18 years on a real breeder. Right? Right. So yeah, there's just, you know, we actually, when they apply, we require years of experience so we can sit down with different customers, different years, different litters, understand how they've grown, developed and matured. If it makes sense, if it checks out, you know, we sit down one on one with the veterinarian team that they use, make sure, you know, everybody can avoid the crossbreeding, inbreeding, genetic health issues. And then if that checks out, we actually go to the breeder physically. So we see the day to day handling, the early neurological stimulation, socialization, we see how they're being kept, not stacked in kennels with their mother. So yeah, there's just a lot of things that we go through. Right. To get good dogs. Yeah. And so they, you were saying, now is a Doxie the same? When you see a Doxie, they say on line, D-O-X-I-E. Is that the same as a, go ahead. No, I mean, that's going to be a mix of a Doxie and a Yorkie. Oh, okay. So they're bigger dogs than a Doxie? Doxies are small. I don't believe we have any Doxies. Okay. Okay. All right. What other breeds do you have? A good majority of breeds out there. So, I mean, what I would honestly suggest for you to do is to sit down and go onto the website, pull up the individual puppies or the breeds, see every breed that we have, look at the breed and see the individual pups. If there's a pup or two that you're looking at, write down their name, most importantly, their ID number. And we can break everything down and kind of go from there. Okay, cool. So, but yeah, so yeah, like I said, you know, my best suggestion is, you know, just to kind of sit down, go through the website, understand it. And once we kind of understand what's going on, you know, reach out, let us know. We'll go from there. Okay. Awesome. Sounds great. Thank you very much. Not a problem. Have a great day. You too.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquired about a specific puppy named Matt, asked about his breed, size, location, and price.

"You're calling Puppy Spots. Brad, how can I help you? Hey, Brad, it is your favorite guy to talk to, Todd Gilman. How are you? I'm doing well, sir. How are you? I'm doing great. I don't know if you saw my text messages from this morning. We have... I... Or maybe you didn't. So we have been... My wife and I, I guess we're going back and forth. Last night we were talking about... Still talking about the dogs that we saw. Yeah, yeah. And I was asking about... Yeah, about Treasure. So we were just kind of curious if we were going to go ahead with the purchase of Treasure, if she's still available, what the timeframe would be for her to come out to LAX, Los Angeles. I know this weekend we happen to be completely booked like all throughout the weekend. And we're just kind of getting a sense of what... So we're probably sitting right about two, two and a half weeks out. Okay? Oh, okay. All right. So give us a time. Yeah, you're going to have a little bit of time. The process that has to happen is I have to get them in for a final legal health certificate, make sure everything's administered, all shots, vaccinations, deworming. Okay? And some breeders schedule appointments with the vet individually. Some breeders have a standing appointment once a week. Right? Okay? So once they get that done, okay, is in my travel department, okay, can go ahead and book travel. Now, when we're talking about travel, it's not like I can jump on Expedia and say, hey, there's a flight, right? Okay? Because we only work with specific planes in specific fleets that has what's called a pet cabin because it is a temperature controlled pressure rise cabin, very similar to what you and I would sit in. Okay? I'm never going to put them in cargo. Okay? So now I know down in Los Angeles area, obviously we have a number of airports and LAX is so major, I wouldn't foresee an issue. Okay? But I also want to go ahead and get them out there as quick as possible. So, you know, it's really just going to depend, you know, which flights are the quickest that's going to be a direct flight with the pet cabin. Okay? But your travel department is going to reach out to you well in advance and they're going to say, you know, hey, this is the date, time, location, that's what we're looking at. Does that work? You'd be able to pick them up moving forward. Here's another question that just came to mind. So how does it, like the dog from Indiana is brought by the breeder to the plane and how does it get to you when you're there? Do they have, it's not like a human representative is going for the flight, are they? Or no? No, no. Because a pet cabin, even though it's very similar to what you and I would sit in, no people are in it because it's a couple of feet below us. Okay? So what's going to happen, breeder takes them to the airport a certain amount of time before travel, gets them all set up. Okay? The airline is there, the last things to go on the airplane and the first things to come off. So what goes ahead and happen is that, you know, once the pup's there, everything's checked in, you know, right before the plane takes off, they put them in the pet cabin. They're going to be in there with other pets at that point in time. Okay? They're going to fly on out. Like I said, they're going to be the first thing to come off. Your travel department is going to send over documentation to you. Okay? Because obviously I'm not just going to give your puppy to anybody and everybody. Okay? So travel's going to send over documentation that you would take in with your ID. They'll tell you where to go, what office in the airport. You won't be able to show everything and pick them up. So, right. So they deliver it to some like specialty cargo type of little room in the, off of the plane. Okay. Like where it's like monitored. So yeah, I was curious. Yeah. I was curious about what the process is. Yeah. We are, I think we're very interested in treasure. We love to see you. Yeah. I mean, what, I guess the question is we have to make the final decision. Can we talk and can I call you in like another two hours from now and what's the schedule? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Let's do this here real quick. Okay. Let me. And I'm sorry about yesterday, by the way. And it wasn't anything like a dangerous situation, but something came up with my daughter where she like for an assignment that she had and I couldn't talk to you. So that's why I was like, kind of a little bit. Yeah. And then we, we talked about it further. My wife and I were like, we really want, and my wife was sensing that I really want this to happen. And like, she's like, yeah, I guess we, you know, as long as it's not, you know, happening this weekend when we're booked up with it's her birthday this weekend, we got like all these plans going on. So like, you know, so she's like, yeah, reach out to Brad and see like what the, you know, sort of the process is. So that's good information. So yeah. So let's, let's coordinate. Do you want me to, me to call you in a couple hours or do you want to call me? Yeah, let me do this. Cause I'm going to step out for just a minute. Okay. But what I did is I went ahead and I put Treasure on hold for roughly about two hours. Okay. Yeah. We're sitting at 12 10 your time. Okay. Correct. So you're, yeah, you're sitting at 12 10 your time. Wait, I actually am going to be on a, a zoom meeting. Let me just see when that, that is that it's a one 30 zoom meeting. It should be done at two o'clock. Can we say 2 15, we connect with each other? Yeah, that'd be great. So let me do this. You can check on me and I'll call you back. I mean, I'll definitely, you know, let's have me call you. If I am, if I'm behind a couple minutes, always bear with me. Okay. So what I did is I put the pump on hold right till about 2 10, 2 15. Okay. This is super exciting. I love it. So I, I will make sure to call you. Like I said, I'm going to step out for a second here. Now that I know that you were sitting over text, like I said, the problem with text, it doesn't always notify me, which is frustrating. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, my wife's like, why don't you just, why don't you just call? And it was much better doing that. So what I did though, is I shot you an email for myself directly. Okay. Yeah. And that's coming from Brad Goldsberry at puppy spot comparatively, and especially cause I'm going to be out for a couple minutes. If you need something, email me, don't call, don't text email. So that way, whether I'm in or out, I get that on my cell immediately as well. But I put the pump on hold. Let me reach out to you about two 15. We'll keep breaking everything down and we'll go from there. That's great. Did you, did you hear of the new name that we're looking at? So the new name is going to be, so since it's going to be a girl, Layla, Layla is going to be the new, like clap that's Layla. That's the name we like. That'd be really cute. Hendrickson Layla. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, we're a big musical family obviously. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that at all. So great. Well, we'll talk it. I'll look forward to your call at about two 15. My time. I won't get nervous. It's a couple of minutes later. Don't worry, but I'll be around. All right, sir. I'll talk to you in just a bit. Okay. Thanks, Brad. Bye. All right. Take care. You too.","{'Summary': 'Todd Gilman called Puppy Spots to inquire about the availability of Treasure and the process of purchasing a puppy.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Andres. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? My name is Shelly Briggs. Hi, Shelly. How are you? I'm good. I'm calling to say I've been looking for quite a while for a miniature pincer. I had one when I lived over in Billings, Montana. Before I moved here, I lived there a long time and I went through it worse and my ex stole my miniature pincer away and gave it to his girlfriend and I was just destroyed because it was my baby. I love that little one because Rocky was the sweetest little miniature pincer I'd ever seen in my life. I've been looking for one again since I've been here. It's just hard to find because it keeps saying, miniature pincer near me. I live in Goodyear, Arizona. It seems like I'll find these places that say miniature pincer for sale near me. Then when I look at it, it's like 300-some miles away and they want to either send it by plane or something like that. It's just like, oh, come on. I'm just trying to find one near me that I can go pick up and get it today if it's here. Yeah. It can be tough, especially when they don't breed these puppies everywhere. Even with us, I'm looking at all the mint pins that we have and all of them but two come from Indiana and then the other place would be Texas. There's two that are coming from Texas and two from Indiana. Those areas are very known for professional breeding. That's currently from what we have for mint pins. Right. It doesn't really matter to me whether or not they're papered or not. I'm not going to be breeding them. I'm not going to be looking to have puppies or any of those things. I just want a sweet little miniature pincer that I can love on. Like I said, that was the sweetest, smartest little dog I had. I mean, literally when I lived in Montana, it gets cold there in the winter and stuff. My little mint pin, when I would need to let him outside, I had a little basket by the front door and I'd tell him, go get your sweater and your slippers. He would run to that basket and bring me a little crocheted sweater and his little slippers he could put on and go out in the snow to pee. He was just so smart. Basically, he would go get everything he needed. I just was amazed at what a smart little guy he was. He was just the best dog I've ever had. I mean, I'd had a chihuahua named Vito before and he was very sweet too. He was basically my grandfather's dog, not mine. My grandpa lived with us. I loved our little Vito dog. Miniature pincers got everybody beat. I think they're the sweetest little dogs I've ever seen. They are pretty determined when it comes to their personality. They're amazing pups. Yeah. Exactly. That's amazing. Well, thank you for sharing all that. Really, at the end of the day, the most important thing when it comes to these pups is where they're coming from and who's handling that entire process for you. We're known for doing all the work that a new puppy owner should know beforehand. That's the service that we do. Instead of you having to figure out what you don't know when it comes to breeding and selecting the right breeder and knowing where the puppy comes from, how they're raised, all that is what we do. We do detailed pet inspections, a license check, procedural check, just to make sure that these puppies are coming from the best of environments when it comes to breeding practices. That's where most of our work is really. Once that's done, we know the puppy's coming from the right places, that they're socialized. Most of them, they grow up around children, around other animals. They go on car rides. They get exposed to different sounds. It pretty much sets them up to be okay with change. When they go into a new environment, into a new family, that can be pretty traumatizing for a puppy that has been caged or has been not in the best environment growing up. All the work that happens behind the transition of the puppy that you want, which is the puppy that you described, being able to create a personality along with you, just want to cuddle and just play all the time. That is what creates that for these puppies. That's really why customers use us. We're able to... Yeah. Minton, even though as small as they are, they have huge personality. They're small dogs, but they have such a great personality. They are so loving. Ever since I moved away from there and didn't have my dog anymore, I couldn't get it. They moved off to Colorado after that. There was nowhere that I could even find him anymore. I was just thinking I was going to try and get him back, but that wasn't going to happen. It was just ugly. Exactly. Once these breeders pass the vetting, you could say, these puppies come on our site. From there, we handle everything from inquiries to the media that you see on their profiles, specific questions you have on the puppy, parents. We can share that. We have access to that, as well as coordinating travel if need be. Most of these puppies and most of our customers, we do have to coordinate travel because they're in the Midwest and Central regions, not all but most. Most of our customers are outside of those regions. It's like the opposite. Even today, it was saying online that it was miniature Pinschers available for sale in Goodyear, which I live in Goodyear. I went looking on there and they wanted $750 for this dog, for these Mintons that live over in Goodyear. I would be more than happy to have the money for it. I would have been willing to go today and get the dog. Then you can't find them. It's just like there's no phone number for them listed to where am I supposed to go to get this dog or where am I supposed to... It's just really frustrating because it just seems like they put it out there that that's supposedly where it's coming from. Then when you look it up, it's like 300 miles away in Texas somewhere or in Indiana. I've seen both of those. I've seen actually both of those locations to get a miniature Pinscher. I think, well, why did they advertise online if it's in Goodyear, Arizona then? It's just frustrating. Yeah. That is where most people can fall into scams because that alone is $700. That alone is the travel and the health certificate. Absolutely. I was already told that by the one place that was, yes, they would get it shipped to me for $700. It would cost to get it to come here, but now it's getting to be hot weather again. It isn't the best time of year to try to send the dog by plane or whatever it is that they're talking about how they would get it to where I am in Goodyear. Oh, interesting. Because they're not where they say they are. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, because these puppies are supposed to be traveling at temperature controlled. These are specifically compartments specifically designed for puppy travel. Yeah, and I would agree with it. Yeah, it doesn't matter what time of the year it is. These puppies, yeah. Whether they go via ground or air, they have no clue. For them, it's the same exact room. It's really amazing what puppy travel has evolved into. Most people have the idea that they go in the back of a truck somewhere, in the back of a plane, but it is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world, animal and pet travel. I think it's just a lot easier on the pup itself if you're just going to be somewhere nearby where you live, where you can go and pick them up and bring them home, and it's not going to be something that's traumatic to them in any way. Because you're going to be loving on them and immediately you've got them in your arms and you're loving on them and they know that they're in a loving spot, but they don't know what's going on. They're going to be sent over from somewhere else or something. I can't deal with that. So anyway, all right. I was just calling to check and see. I wasn't sure. This is the first place that I saw that. Well, I guess I haven't gone to puppy spot before, but the first time there was a phone number you could call and get a hold of a real person and try to see where they're at and where you could possibly find one near me or something, or if that's even possible. But it doesn't seem like it because everything I've been looking for, they tell you one thing and then when it comes right down to it, that's not the way it is. If you'd like to take a look at the ones that we have, I can send you a link and an email and just thanking you here for the conversation. You can take a look and see if you like any of the pups that we have there. If you're willing to continue speaking or you have more questions, feel free to give us a call. So you have how many different kinds of pups? Several different breeds? We have a lot of breeds. We have over 2,000 puppies on our website right now. Wow. Yeah, and a lot of puppies are placed every single week. But there's a lot of breeds there. You can have a lot of fun just by looking at these puppies. But if you go to our website at puppiespot.com, you're going to see a tab that says Puppies, view all puppies and you can filter by miniature pinchers by breed. And you'll see all the ones that we currently have available. So you do currently have miniature pinchers that are available? We do, yeah. Where is that from? You said they're from Indiana or something? So there's four that are from Indiana and they're from the same litter. And there's two that are from Texas, same litter as well. Okay. So they aren't where you would be having them near me or like in Goodyear or close in Arizona rather than in Indiana or somewhere? In Arizona, we don't have any MinPins. These are the only places where we have MinPins right now. Okay. Yeah, I've seen that several times online. It seems like those seem to be the two places that they're coming from and they're coming from large. Yeah. And I know that the ones from Indiana, they were saying it would be $700 to get them here and that's not even the price of the puppy yet. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah. So I guess I'm going to have to keep looking and find out what I can find out here. Okay. All right, Shelly. Well, best of luck. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you so much. I appreciate the information. My pleasure. Really, you too. My pleasure. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer looking for a miniature pinscher near Goodyear, Arizona.

"Thank you for calling Puppy. How can we help you? I was looking for Gina. This is Laura Saphir. I called about Puppy Ajax. Hi, Laura. This is Gina speaking. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Good. Thank you for asking. Give me one second here. Okay. One moment. Okay, Laura. Thanks for patience and holding there. And thank you for calling back. How can I help you? So I was just wondering about Ajax and like questions like how big will he be? He's a full adult, like around approximately. Okay. So his parent size is what we use to kind of estimate things. Mom and dad are between 25 and 35 pounds. So he could grow, you know, to be anywhere within that range. Have you owned Frenchies before? No, I haven't. But I had a teacup Maltese for 13 years. She died a couple of years ago and I'm just still getting over her. I hear you. I hear you. What made you choose a French full adult? I was just looking online at like low maintenance because like I know my Maltese. I always had her hair cut short. And it was like she had to go get grooming at least twice a month. And I'm just looking for something where I'm not having to like go to deal with that. Right. I'm not having to worry about myself and it's just that they were like good compatible home pet. You know, I just, you know, lay on the couch with me and go to bed with me. I need a companion. Yeah. They're great companions, you know. You know, they've got pretty moderate energy. So if you want to hang out and chill, they're happy to do that. You know, if you want to get out and take a walk, they're fine with doing that. But they don't require a whole lot of exercise, you know, and definitely don't require a lot of, you know, the grooming and things like that. Just, you know, French Bulldogs, they have, you know, lower cut, you know, they're short on their fur coats are here. So they just kind of and they said they were low shedding. So they weren't like major shedding. So a bath is fine. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you calling us from? I'm in Portland, Oregon. Okay. Okay. Where are you? And yeah, so Ajax is coming to you from Indiana. Okay. Okay. Indiana. Okay. Yeah. All of our puppies, they're raised by breeders that are in the Midwest. Okay. So if you're in Oregon, then you know, we offer delivery of the puppy home to you, you know, so we can bring any puppy home to you and your family. There is a charge for it. It's $711. And this litter is five weeks old. So they're going to be ready. It's about two weeks after availability date. So the availability date is May 15. May 15. Okay. Yeah. And sent me a beautiful puppy. And you affirm on the price of $44.55? Yeah, the price is $55.99 plus tax. Oh, $55.99. There is some financing available if you need it, you know, to help with any amount, but you know, you want to delay, you know, the billing on. So we do have a partner, it's called Terrace Finance. There's a short little application that you fill out. I can email it to you. We also accept PayPal credit as well. You know, but yeah, so what you're looking at... I could just put it on my credit card. On your credit card. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what you'd be looking at, let's see here. What's your zip code where you're contacting us from? It's 97206. Okay. And do they fly AJAX? Does he fly or does somebody actually bring him? No. He's driven. Okay. Yeah. We can't fly French Borders. Yeah, my Maltese actually flew from Los Angeles. I used to live in California, but I lived in Northern California. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's a different breed. So Maltese is a standard breed. French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, Shih Tzus, they're called snub-nosed breeds. So snub-nosed breeds, the breeds that have the little, you know, flat face. They cannot fly by themselves. When we offer a flight, it would be in the main cabin with the pet nanny, which really isn't necessary, but you can certainly use that service from us. And it's $1,999 for the pet nanny. So that's, it's really not necessary. We only really encourage the pet nannies if the puppy is like, you know, a little small breed like Chihuahuas, you know, little Yorkies that are like one to two pounds, you know, they need that service. But the Frenchie would do fine traveling with our handler. We've worked with that program for 17 years. They do an excellent job and they would drive out and they bring the puppy to a location near you for picking up. Okay. So we'll come as close as possible to you. It's not to your door, but it'll be in your local area. Yeah. So I do have a little $300 off promotion that I can add, but also it requires that you do microchipping. So what you'd be looking at would be $62.47 would be the total with delivery. And it looks like in your state you don't have taxes or anything like that. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I added the promo for that. The microchipping is just $49. So I added that. And then I emailed you the parents so that you can see what the mom and the dad look like. They're super cute as well. And is he papered, is AJAX papers? He has papers or? Of course. Of course. Okay. Yeah. We can't sell unregistered pets. Yeah. They are. Oh. They're AKC. Okay. Yeah. So the puppy's registered as a companion for you. Okay. And you can change the name, you know, of the puppy as well. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But he's a great toy. Yeah. Yeah. If you want me to put him on hold for you. Can I, if you put him on hold, am I obligated? Because I'm still thinking like I'm a big obligation and I'm like I do want to pet. Oh, no. So we only put a puppy on hold if you're going to purchase the dog. And we only put it on hold for up to one hour. If you need to think about it, that's fine. You know, take your time. But we can't take the puppy away from other families. Okay. So yeah. But I, yeah. But I did email over to you all of the information. So when you're ready, just give me, you know, a call back and we'll get it all set up for you. All right. Yeah. I got one email. Then it said it expired. And I was like, oh. So maybe I got a new one because I was like, oh, I didn't realize it expired. Okay. I saw the, okay. I see the photos. Okay. Okay. All righty. Well, you enjoy your day. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'Laura inquired about a French Bulldog named Ajax, asking about his size, temperament, and delivery options.

"Hi Talia. Hi. Hi it's Fran from puppy spot. Are you looking for a maltese? Hi. Oh I was confused. Yeah I'm currently looking around for like a maltipoo or I think it's called a cav... I don't know how to pronounce it. A cavaloo? Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm just, me and my boyfriend are just like you know looking into both of them and seeing you know which one would be best because I do have a dog already. Oh what kind of dog do you have? I have a mini labradoodle. Oh cute. What's got you looking for another dog? So he has really bad anxiety so I'm leaving him home. It's like torture to him so we were hoping to find like another dog to like you know like be his support dog in a way but also for us too. Yeah to like have another pet around. Yeah for sure. Yeah so he's not scared when we leave him or whatever. Yeah. I don't think he's home alone. Yeah definitely. Well is there anything... Oh go ahead. No no no I'm listening go ahead. Yeah is there anything I could tell you about you know any like of the breeds like do you have questions about cavapoos or maltipoos or? So I was looking at the maltipoo on Puffy Spot and I was just curious on like how big they get or how small they stay because after looking at the dog we were like he's so cute and then remembered my dog likes to pee on smaller dogs. Oh my god. Yeah that's another thing. That is so funny. I don't know if I've ever heard somebody say that. So it depends. I mean you know maltipoos are typically really small. We have some that are probably gonna be like five pounds or less full-grown and some that could probably get up to like maybe 15 pounds. So it really depends on the specific puppy that you're looking at and a good way to determine their adult weight would be to look at the parents weight and kind of see you know how big the parents are and that would help give you a good idea of how big the puppy might be full-grown. But yeah it would just probably depend on the specific puppy. I'm gonna pull back up my Puffy Spot account to see the dog that I was looking into. I forgot the name. I should have a screenshot here. Yeah I saw that you were looking at a Maltese named Buttons. Yes I was. Buttons yes. Yeah he's probably gonna be about like you know maybe 10 to 12 pounds full-grown. Yeah but he was so cute. My boyfriend said we'll finish up the conversation when he gets home today like to see you know if that's the route we're gonna go. Okay got it. So yeah I mean any Maltese or Maltipoo that you're looking at is probably gonna be less than 15 pounds full-grown. So if you're you know worried about getting a dog that's too small you know I don't know if like a Maltese or a Maltipoo would be the best breed because they are typically you know quite a bit smaller than other breeds. Yeah you see I was hoping that they would they're so cute I was hoping that they're probably just get a little bigger. Yeah they are so cute. But I don't want a dog his size right he is one years old and he is 35 pounds. He's not too big not too small but I don't want nothing his size again. You want something smaller? A tad bit smaller but not drastically smaller where he would think like you know I think dominant is dominant is a big thing with the whole peeing on other smaller dogs. Yeah. So something maybe like around 15 to 20 pounds. Yeah yeah well we definitely have you know and the Cavapoos are a really good breed like they're really good with other dogs. They're so sweet. They're really laid-back you know they're good family dogs and Cavapoos definitely a lot of times are between that 15 to 20 pound range. So you know that might be a good choice to look into as well. Yeah so can I save your number and my partner gets all stuck around 4 o'clock and can we just like go over everything and see where we can go from then on? Yeah totally yeah just feel free to save my number and you can definitely give me a call later if you have any questions. I'll also send you my email so you can you know email me back if you have questions or my number will be there so you can give me a call. Gotcha and just one last question I saw on puppy spot it said that we can pick like if we go ahead and purchase the dog we can pick it up or it's like meet up. Do you mind like me asking you what state you're in so I can know? Yeah so it really depends. We are nationally based so we don't have like one store where all of our puppies are. They just stay with their breeder till it's time for them to go home. So depending on which puppy you're looking at that would determine their location. But we can travel any puppy to you if they're not already local. So you know you would just have to keep me updated let me know which puppy you might be interested in so I could tell you where they are because unfortunately you are unable to filter on the customer side of the website you know where the puppy is but I am able to give you that info you know if you ask me. Gotcha, gotcha. I thought you were the breeder that's why but I get how it is now I get it. Yeah yeah I am not the breeder but I work directly with the breeder so if you ever had any questions you know I can just give the breeder a quick call and answer any questions for you but I also do have a bunch of extra information to help you make your decision. I got you thank you so much I'm definitely gonna go ahead and save your number and I'm going to I rather email you other than me calling you. Yeah email yeah that works great okay perfect well just let me know if you need me and hopefully we can talk with you soon. Thank you hopefully we can talk soon. Alright talk to you later. Bye bye.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquired about the size of a specific puppy and asked for recommendations for a breed that is not too small but not as big as their current dog.

"Hello? Hello? Oh, hi, I was looking for Liz. Speaking. Hi, my name is Liz calling from Puppy Spot. I was calling about Trixie, the Cavalier puppy you inquired about. Yeah, how are you doing today? Good, how are you? I'm good. And how's Wesley doing? Oh my God, he's amazing. Is he still called Wesley? Yep. Oh, that's my son's name. I love it. I absolutely love it. He's so regal. Have you ever seen the movie The Princess Bride? Of course, Wesley. Yeah. Right now, so here's the challenge. Do we rename Trixie Buttercup? Yes, a thousand percent. That's the only question I have. I'm done. You can talk to him. Okay, sold. Yeah, that would be a really cute name for a puppy. Yeah, she's really cute. But yeah, so Wesley's doing wonderful. And, you know, we were just thinking he's just two and a half, I think now. And it might be a good time to bring in a new sibling. A new little buddy. Yeah, they like, I mean, that's a good age. I waited too long when I got my puppy. My dog was like, 10, he was 10. Yeah. And he really suffered from having a puppy biting on him. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah, Wesley's still kind of a puppy. Yeah, for sure. I think they would have a blast. So, as far as Trixie goes, she's nine weeks old. Let me make sure here. Somehow I just lost her page. Let's see where it went. Oh my goodness, where did I go? I had it and it was gone. Close. Let me, just give me one second. I'm going to pull this up. Sure, no worries. I'll just do it a different way. I'm just driving. I hope the background noise isn't bad. Oh, it's fine. What part, you guys are in Massachusetts? We are. What part? So I live just this side of the Cape. Cape Cod. Okay, yeah, I used to live in the Berkshires. I just sold my house there a couple months ago. Oh, you did? Oh, it's so beautiful up there too. It was. It was just a little bit too isolated. So our kids are out in college in Utah, so we came out this way. How good for you. I know. I'm in Utah. I'm in Utah. I'm in ski country out here. Wow. How's the ocean? The ocean, we have three feet of snow still in our backyard. Today is finally a warm day. It's like in the 70s, so hopefully a lot of it will melt, but not too fast or we'll be in another problem. Right, exactly. So, yeah, so Trixie is nine weeks old. Her parents are 12 to 16 pounds. Oh, she's so cute. Look at her paw on that ball. And then a week ago she weighed in like two, two and a half pounds, so she's probably up to about three pounds right now. Okay. So she's still a little mini, but she'll get there. Her parents are the same color. They're both tricolor as well. Okay. All right. And the mature parents you said are 16 pounds? So the dad is about 15 and mom's about 13 average. Right. So that's what we would expect of the mature. I would say she'll probably be 13 or 14 maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's a good size for us. How big is Wesley? He is 22. He's a big boy. Yeah. He's, yeah, because he's all muscle. We live near the beach and he runs on the beach every single day. Oh, fun. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. He rides a bike. What do you mean he rides a bike? You mean like in a basket? In a basket, yeah. Oh, that's so cute. This has been our big dilemma of what do we do, you know? Well, now you have one for each of you. I know, that's true. It's a good thing we ride e-bikes. Oh, yeah. I'm not familiar. So you're in Ayer, Massachusetts? No, I changed my address online. I'm in Marion. Yeah. Oh, okay. You're in Marion it's called? Yeah. Oh, I see that now. Blueberry Way. Cute. Yeah. Do you have blueberries there? Yeah. Kind of. All right. What else can I tell you about her? Okay. And so I know that the price drops, you know, every week or every day or I'm not really sure what your map is. So is this kind of like the best price I can get? Let me see what we can do. Sometimes we have little promos going on. Let me check. That would be wonderful. So we have like a $300. It includes like if you get the pup pack, you get like $100 off. The pup pack is like all her own bed and blanket and toys and leaves that would come, all new stuff that would come next week by FedEx. And then you get $100 off on top of that. So it's like a $300 value. Okay. How about if we skip that and you just take it off the retail price? Let me see. Let me see if I can find a different promo then. Hold on one second. All right. Okay. Then we have all the other fees you're going to add on too, right? The only, well, so there's the transportation at $711. Let's see what it was when you got Wesley. I think it's right around here. Oh yeah. It was more. It was seven. So it has gone down a little bit. It was $799. Oh, you did get the pup pack before. And then she does come microchipped. So Puppy Spot has a program to register her microchip for $49 for one. It's just a one-time fee for her lifetime. So the microchip is already implanted. It just doesn't point to anything until you register it. But not every breeder microchips. So it's nice that this breeder actually does that. Right. Wesley came with the chip, but it wasn't embedded. So the total, so I took off the pup pack. So just the estate 300 off. So the 3409 would be the total of tax and delivery. And when could we expect to see her? About two weeks. So she's coming from Missouri. So we'll get her final of that check done this week. Make sure all her shops are up to date and her paperwork is in order. And then we will, in about a week, we'll schedule the transportation. So like we usually send you a travel proposal in about 10 days from when you pay. And then your puppy usually comes about a week to 10 days after that. Okay. Okay. So we say two to three weeks from when you pay just because we do like to get puppies home within that two week mark. But it just kind of depends on the rotation. We go once a week to the New England area. So it just kind of depends on where it falls in the rotation of the schedule. Where would they fly into? So a lot of times, well, she may fly or drive. And so our travel team would let you know. Lately, we have been driving puppies a lot more than we've been flying them because the airlines are super unreliable. We don't like to take risk. You know, we don't want to take a risk with a puppy having to sit and wait. So most likely it would, she would be driven and then they would kind of build a route based on what other families in your area have purchased puppies and then they let you know. It's usually within like an hour or two of where you live. Are you close? You're close down to the Cape. So like Boston's like a little over an hour or something. Yeah. Yeah. So like not usually in Boston, but outside like we used to go to Hanscom a lot. Right. I think that's where Wesley came in. Yeah. We did. I think back then we had our own plane. We don't do that anymore. We had to do that during the pandemic because we had no other options, but it was super expensive for us to do that. So now we have mostly been driving or if we do fly, they usually fly on American Airlines because they have reinstated their pet safe travel, but it's the same flat rate, $711. Either way, we just, you know, our travel team will figure it out. Where's the dog coming from? Missouri. Missouri. Yeah. So have a little Southern accent, a little buttercup. All right, Liz, can you do me a favor? Can you forward me the proposal to my email address? Yeah. And then we're just going to chat a little bit more. And then can you give me a call back like tomorrow morning? I couldn't call. Can I call you later today? You can call me probably like eight o'clock. Yeah, that's fine because I'm out in Utah. So it's two hours earlier here. So I'll call you around six o'clock my time. All right. Sounds good. All right. So I'm emailing you. It's basically the portal to pay, but it'll like if you click through the first page, it'll show you broken out like the line items. And then and then if you click on checkout, it'll just take you to to go ahead and pay if you're ready to do that. And it'll send me a notification. But other than that, you know, I can call you around eight o'clock and then we do have a you know, just a small adoption interview to go through as well. OK. Awesome. All right. Well, it's nice talking to you. Have a good day. OK. Bye.","{'Summary': ""Liz from Puppy Spot called to discuss Trixie, a Cavalier puppy.

"Hi, this is Lynn. Yes, hello. Hi. Hey, yeah, it's Ron speaking. You called me earlier today. I couldn't answer. Sorry. Okay. You said Ron? Yeah, about the dog, Lightning. What kind of puppy is it, Ron? It's a mini Dachshund. Okay. You know what? Oh, yeah, I see you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's from Arizona. Ron Labby, however you spell. Yes, ma'am. Okay. All right. And have you had Dachshunds before? What is that? Have you owned a Dachshund before? Oh, a Dachshund, no. But my brother did. Okay. All right. Give me one second. Let me take a look. The puppy you were asking about was Alfreda, which is a very strange name. You don't have to keep it, by the way. No. To be honest, I also saw Alfreda and also Lightning. Okay. Hold on. Give me one sec. Okay. Let me find her first. 732. 732. Okay. So she is a chocolate and tan. Alfreda is the first one. She is eight weeks old and she is a chocolate and tan. She is a miniature long-haired Dachshund. That's Alfreda. Yeah. Okay. Long hair. Yeah. Yeah. She is very cute, though. She is. Oh, my gosh. She is cute. Can you send me to my number like you sent me about Lightning? What is it you want? I'm sorry? Because I want to see her again, Alfreda. I'm trying to look. The thing is this. Oh, I see her. I don't have the pictures that are on the site in email. You have to look at her on the website. Okay. And who was the other puppy you were looking at? Lightning. Lightning. Yeah. No. Alfreda. Hold on. Let me take a look at Lightning. Hold on. Okay. Yeah. Lightning. I saw that. Fifteen weeks old. He is. This is a boy. He is like the red color. And he is also a miniature long-haired. Yeah. But I think I prefer Alfreda. Yeah. Me, too. She is really cute. Yeah. I do, too. Not that. I mean, they are all puppies. They are all cute. But she is really cute. She is best. She is really beautiful. Yeah. Do you know if she gets big or mini-mini? Give me a quick second. All our dogs are mini. She is a miniature. Her mom weighs about 10 to 12 pounds. Her dad is about 12 to 14. So she is going to be small. Somewhere probably within the 10 to 12 pound range. As of a few days ago, she weighed 2 1⁄2 to 3 pounds. She is still little. She is a little. All right. Little, little, little. She has absolutely gorgeous parents. I can actually send you pictures. They are beautiful. All our puppies, just so you know, go home health checked. She would be up to date on her vaccinations, worming. She is, of course, AKC registered. And all the puppies we sell come with a 10-year health commitment through the website. Just so you know, we have actually had this website now for 16 years. So we are not in the site. So what do you mean 10 years health? It is not insurance for the dog, right? No, it is not insurance. It is a guarantee against genetic or hereditary diseases that might come up that are life-threatening. And let's God forbid, but it is like life insurance. If she is not going to survive, then we guarantee that you would, depending upon the age and the situation, you would get another puppy. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but she is adorable. Amazing. Are you sending me a picture of the mom and dad? Yeah, I am going to send it to you right now. Give me one sec. I want to put the information. Hold on. I am going to send it to your email. It is going to say, parents photos for Alfreda. Let's see. Beautiful. First one is dad, second one is mom. If I got the email, maybe it is in the spam or something. Yeah, oh no. Oh no. I didn't get it. It takes a minute. It is pictures. I got it. So are they located in Arizona? Like how does it work? No, no. They are not. We are a breeder network, so we work with private breeders all over the country. I can't guarantee that I have a dachshund in Arizona. She comes from Indiana, but we obviously have delivery options for her. Did you get the pictures yet? Let me see. I guess you should have them. Yeah, I still didn't receive it. Maybe I will give it another minute. No, not yet. That is weird. Can you read me the email? Maybe I put it in the correct place. It looks like rlazi56 at Gmail. Yeah, yeah. Can you refresh your pen? Yeah, because you should have it. It is going to say parent pictures for Alfreda. I sent them. They went. I don't know where I can get it. Okay, so anyways, meanwhile, how does it work? Let me text them to you. Okay. I don't know why you didn't get them. That is weird. Hold on. I will text them to you. It is nicer to see them in the email because they are bigger. Yeah, I got it. Okay, first picture is mom. Second picture is dad. So this is how they are basically going to look? Plus, minus? Well, her color is not exactly the same, but that is what she will look like as far as she will have the long coat. She is the chocolate and pants. Yeah. Very cute. Beautiful puppy. Yeah. Wow. So, yeah, how does it work basically? Yeah, if you decide you are interested, we screen our buyers. We go over some quick questions with you. We put her on hold. We send you an invoice to an email. We don't take payments on the phone. We take credit cards, debit cards. We take PayPal. We accept PayPal credit. And we also offer financing, which is not done to us. So you would have to fill out an application if that is something you are interested in. And then once you purchase the puppy, it says on the website she is on hold. She would go to the vet. She would get her health checks done. She would get her first puppy shot. We don't send puppies home without what we call a state-issued health certificate from the breeder's vet. Once we get that, then they make arrangements for her to come home. And they send it? Yeah, she gets flown. And how long does it usually take? From start to finish, it's about two weeks. Okay. So do you have any many dachshunds in Arizona? I do not. I do not. Not at all? I doubt it. I'll look for it, but I don't think so. Okay. Give me a second. No, I do not. She is a beautiful puppy, though. Yeah. Do you have pictures of Lightning, mom and dad, by any chance? Give me a second. Yep, I do. Let me send those to you. You never got the email with the pictures of the parents? Very strange. Yeah, I didn't get it. That's very odd. I don't know why. Sometimes you have to refresh your page, but you should get an email. Oh, yeah, I got it. I was in the promotions. Oh, there you go. Yeah, I got them. Okay. Yeah, very nice dogs. Yeah, they're beautiful. Seven, two, seven. And the price is the price, like final price? There's no like... I don't... They're not our dogs. We can't change prices. The only thing I can do, either puppy right now, I can give you $300 discount off the puppy price. We have a promotion going. $300 off? Yeah, we have a promotion going right now. I'm sorry, one second. I'm trying to get the other puppy in here, so I can send the pictures. All right, I'm going to send an email with Lightning's parents, okay? Now that you know how to find them, okay? Yeah, perfect. Thank you. First one's dad, second one's mom. It takes a minute, but I just sent those to you. Yeah, wow. So her mom is a different color. Yeah, of course. They color... They carry recessive color genes. So certain combinations produce certain colors. That's how that works. So it's going to look like her dad, like his dad. Yeah, exactly. She looks more like dad. Wow, that's nice. That's really cute. Oh my God. Yeah. And the Lightning's price now is, I think it's... On the website, it's $26.49, and I can give you the $300 off on that price. Oh, okay. And where is Lightning located? Lightning is, I should know it by heart, Ohio. Ohio, okay. Transportation's the same. That's not going to change. Yeah, same thing. Okay, so wow. So yeah, I need to think about it a little bit, but when can I call you back? Like, when should I call you back? Whenever you want. I work from home. If you don't, you can just leave me a message if I don't answer, and I'll... You know what I'll do? Here, I sent you a text message with the pictures. If you decide, like it's later and you're not sure, just text me, and then tell me to call you, and then I'll call you back whenever you need me to, because I work from home. Sounds good. What's your name? Lynn. Lynn, all right, Lynn. Thank you so much. I'll send you an email with my direct contact info, okay? Perfect. Sounds good, Lynn. Okay, no problem. Thank you. Thank you.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Paul. How can I help you? Hi, I was just wondering, we live in New Jersey, but I found a dog on, I have his puppy number. I'm just wondering where he's located. Okay, and I'm sorry, your first name? Lisa, L-I-S-A. Lisa, how are you this morning? I'm doing fine. I've never, I'm like confused. Are you guys like a broker or like? So what we are is we're a national network for breeders. Brokers would take possession of the puppies and then distribute them. Our puppies stay with moms, stay with the breeder in the breeder's home. So when you purchase a pup, we let you know where that pup is coming from even before you purchase it. Because you do have the option when you purchase to pick up or we can travel to you. So the nice thing about our service is not only do you get access to litters all over the country, but the pups being brought up in the home underfoot, they're being exposed to normal everyday life instead of sitting in a cage in a window in a pet store. No, no, no, I agree. I was just wondering if he's what we're looking for. But I'm not sure, like I just happen to be breathing through. Can I give you his ID number? Absolutely, go ahead. It's 732301. His name is Axel. Oh, is that the bird-a-doodle? Yeah. I actually had several people request information yesterday on that puppy. Bear with me just for a second. Let me bring up his info. As long as my computer cooperates. Did you watch the video? I did. He's adorable. He is adorable. It doesn't say if he's a mini or not. It just says like... Yeah, he's going to be a medium. He's going to be somewhere probably between 30 and 40 pounds full grown. Okay, because we have a mini Newfie Poo. It's a Newfoundland and a Poodle and it almost looks like the same kind of thing going on here. Because his mom's weight and dad's weight was similar to Oliver's. Yeah, they try and breed them down in size, but you can only go so far when you start with a dog as large as a Bernice or with a Newfie. Yeah, with a Newfie. No, no, no, that's fine weight. I was just wondering. So he is being raised in the home underfoot, being exposed to things like the vacuum cleaner, the TV, the doorbell, the garbage disposal. He's being socialized with young and older children with large and small breed dogs. Mom is the Bernice, dad is the Poodle and coming to you from our breeder in Ohio. So if you decided that you wanted to get this puppy, what we would do is we would go through, gather all of your information. We'd go through some acknowledgments because we want to make sure we set the proper expectations. And then we review the travel or the pickup and send you a payment link. Payment link would come to you in your email. We only accept major credit cards, debit cards or regular PayPal for your protection. Once the pup is paid for, secured as yours, we then schedule the puppy's final vet exam. Our veterinary staff reviews that to make sure there are no issues and nothing noted because we do provide a 10 year health guarantee on our puppies. And that covers anything hereditary or congenital. That's the best in the pet industry. And then we confirm the travel. So usually when we're traveling a pup to you because we're at the mercy of the vet schedule, the availability of travel and the craziness of Mother Nature, we set the expectation of two to three weeks to get a pup home. But we've been getting puppies home in two weeks or less. OK, now may I ask, just wondering, how much would it be if I had him shipped here from Ohio to New Jersey? Not saying that I can't go out and pick him up. I mean, that's no, no, absolutely. But so even if you're even if you're going out to pick him up, there's still a charge for the final vet exam, the health certificate that's in your name, and there's a couple of other things required for the pup to be able to travel. That's two hundred and eighty seven dollars. If we're traveling the pup, well, if we're traveling the pup to you, it's seven hundred and eleven. It's the two eighty seven plus the four twenty four for the travel. The four twenty four is a flat fee anywhere in the country. But that is together with that final vet exam and health certificate. So it's seven hundred and eleven dollars anywhere in the country. Doesn't matter where you are or where the puppy is. So basically you guys would drop them at my home? No, it would be at a public location near you. What happens is our our transporter, there'll be multiple puppies going to your area and the transporter will pick. Perfect. The transporter will pick a central location in between everybody and that's where he'll have you meet. We do everything in public for everyone's safety and security. No, I agree with you. It was I was just wondering, how about this? What I'm wondering is, like, say we live in New Jersey. Would it be like like would it be close to Philadelphia? Would it be an hour away? Would it be a half hour away? Like, I'm kind of it's usually within an hour of your home. Got it. OK, no, no, no. That's fine. That's perfect. We actually we have an office. We have an office in Jersey City. I work out of our Hollywood, Florida office, but we have an office in Jersey City, Lehigh, Utah and Culver City, California. OK, Jersey City. Yep. I'm my daughter lives in Hoboken. OK, now is he before I waste any of it? Is he available or is he taking his? No, he is still available. So on our Web site, if a pup is spoken for, it'll say I found a new home or reserved. Oh, OK. Got it. Now, my husband, my husband is just having surgery right now. What is it? How do I go about like say I the minute he's like we get home because I just saw him and he's like he's absolutely adorable. So I'm waiting for my husband to get out of surgery. So I can go about serving him so I can do a four hour courtesy hold. But that's all that the system allows me to do without payment. And I don't like taking deposits because deposits are non-refundable and it's four hundred ninety five dollars. So, I mean, I can put a four hour hold on him. That'll be until noontime. I don't I mean, that way you can hit your husband while he's still groggy and under anesthesia to get him to say yes. Right, right. What was I going to. All right. So what I Lisa, it looks like you filled out all of your information on our Web site. I'm going to send you I'm going to send you a couple of emails. The first one is titled Your Pup with Perks, and that's going to go over everything, all the different travel, including the pickup, the 10 year health guarantee, the microchipping. I'm sending you pictures of mom and dad. Let me just make sure I have both parents pictures. There's dad, there's mom. And then I'm going to email you all of his pictures so that you have them in your email. That way you don't have to fish through the Web site. But so you'll have three emails from Paul at Puppy Spot. If you don't see the parent photos and you have the other two, look in your promotions folder. Most people don't even know they have a promotions folder. But this is only with Gmail accounts. For some reason, the parent photos, 50 percent of the time go into this foolish promotions folder. Everything else will go in your inbox. You're right. It did go in promotions. Oh, OK, cool. But then that way you have all of that information. You have my name, my contact information. And just let me know what you decide. Can you do? Yeah, obviously. Oh, that's so cute. Yes. Can you do a four hour hold? You should be out in the next hour or so. OK. And then you said, because I would only only feel comfortable putting it on a credit card just in case like I've never. Oh, no, absolutely. We always tell people we listen to at least 10 stories a day. At least I do. People being scammed or almost scammed. We've been on. We've been on Good Morning America and Fox and Friends. Both news programs had us on to help educate their customers on how to avoid scams. Well, yeah, that's the whole thing where it's like I've never purchased a puppy. Like obviously you go in a dog, but I can't seem to find this color. I mean, it's tough right now. And he's he's absolutely adorable. And when I do find it, it's a female. And I do not want to deal with it. I just I don't want to deal with a female. I just I know I hear you. I understand completely. All right. Thank you so much, Paul. And is this your direct line at the bottom? The 866 or no. So as long as as long as you call from the same phone, you're using the 7 7 8 7. The system the system has all of your information logged under my name. So when you call in from your phone, it's going to automatically direct you to me. So now you're kind of stuck with me. Oh, perfect. OK, no problem. All right. Listen, he's so, so cute. Oh, my gosh. All right. You will be in contact. OK, thank you so much for your all your information. You're welcome. Have a great day. And hopefully we talk soon. All right. Thanks, Paul. Have a great day. Bye bye. Bye bye.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquires about the location and details of a specific puppy.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Sarah. How can I help you? Good morning, Sarah. I was calling to get some information about a puppy I saw online here. For Fletcher, puppy ID number is 733131. The Labradoodle. Correct. All right. He is a standard F1B. So dad is a standard poodle and mom is a Labradoodle. He'll be about 65 pounds fully grown. He's neither the largest nor the smallest in the litter, so that should be correct. Pictures are up to date. They were done three days ago. No health or cosmetic issues. He's been socialized with small and large breed dogs, older and younger children. He's been around, he's been raised in a home, so he has been around the vacuum cleaner, garbage disposal, dishwasher, and doorbell. Let's see. Mom and dad are clear. No health issues at all. Puppy would be coming to you from Missouri. It's actually a breeder that's been with us for a long time. All of our breeders are... This is an invitation only website, so a breeder can't randomly decide to post pictures and sell puppies on our website. They have to be fully approved to do so. So this breeder has actually been with us since 2011. Let's see. Puppies come home microchipped. They live on 13 acres with a pond. They run around all day long. They have toddlers, young adults, kids, dogs. Yep. So these guys are active and out. Breeder focuses, when it comes to potty training, their focus is just to get the dogs outside to go potty and get used to that before going home. Parents, the poodle is AKC registered. Mom is a Labradoodle, but she came from both AKC Lab and AKC Doodle, Poodle Doodle. Okay. And then as far as hypoallergenic, Sarah, is this... Because I know some dogs, they might be a little more on the hypoallergenic side. Some are a little less. What's the deal with Fletcher? So the hypoallergenic dog in this mix is a poodle. Poodles have very strong genetic traits. They actually overpower genetically most breeds. You are basically, on this side, you are 75% poodle and 25% Labrador. And even with that, since the genetics are even stronger, you're probably more like an 85-15. Because if you were 50-50, if it was a Labrador retriever and a poodle, even if you'd say, okay, it's 50-50, because of the genetics of the poodle, you're kind of more like 65-35. It always leans to the poodle side. Okay, because of the overpowering on the poodle side. Right. Okay. Exactly. And then as far as shedding, do they shed? Sorry. No, because... Yeah, I always make sure I want to explain this well. So you have hair, I have hair, but we don't shed. We lose our hair in a brush. A dog that sheds has fur. Fur has an undercoat, undercoat's release, there's your shedding, there's your tumbleweeds in your hallway. Poodles, they have hair, they don't have fur. So when you brush them, yes, you still have to brush them, and just because hair will come out, but they never have a shed like a Labrador would. So it's just one of those things where if you just take a brush over them occasionally, the great thing about dogs that have fur and not hair is that you can clip them how you want them. You can't clip a dog with fur, otherwise their coat comes in too dense. So with a poodle, with a Labradoodle, you can, you know, summertime you can clip it down a little bit, or you can leave it longer, or you can like shave their face and make them look cute. So yeah, so you're able to really play grooming-wise with how the puppy ends up looking. Got it. Okay. And you said it's coming from Missouri. I live in California. Is there going to be like the transportation fee other than this $35.49 price that's on the website? Yeah. So what is additional to the puppy? Because that is the puppy's price. What is additional is three things. One, just like when you buy a home, and you do a home inspection to make sure there's no cracks in the foundation, prior to the puppy departing from the breeder, there's a full veterinary health inspection. Puppies already seen a veterinarian, had checkup, shots, dewormed, everything else. This is on your behalf. Nose to tail, spine, hip, heart, knee, bite alignment, kneecaps, et cetera. They create a report. That report comes into our health team here. They review it. If there's anything that's not 100%, they call you to go over it with you. It's at that time that you can, even though that everything's in process, you've paid for the dog, everything else, if they get to that point and they say, oh, Fletcher has an XYZ, it might be something tiny and dumb, like a slight underbite. You're like, whatever, send me my puppy. It could be something catastrophic where we call you up and say, oh, he has a grade four heart murmur. We can't send him home. Would you like to pick out another dog or get a full refund? Or it could be something in the middle of the road. You might say, I'm just not comfortable with that. Let's pick another dog or let me get a full refund. All of the monies that you pay stay in-house until puppy is home with you because of that reason. You don't have to refund you should there be any kind of health issue with Fletcher. So that is one thing, that health exam. That report comes home with the puppy, so you're able to give that to your veterinarian as a baseline. So that report and all of that information is 287, the vet going out and doing all this. That's 287. Travel-wise, we travel pet safe flight or ground transportation. It does not matter how the breeder and our travel department decides to travel your pup to you. It could be a combination. It could be one. It could be the other. It's always a flat rate of 424. So you have your veterinarian at 287. You travel at 424. Total there is 711. And then whatever your local sales tax is in California. So usually when people look on the website, I'll tell them, go ahead and add about $1,000 to the total price and that should cover you for everything. All three items. I see. Okay. That's pretty expensive. Let's see. So we're basically looking at roughly $4,600, a little more. Yeah. I would say, yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know what your sales tax is there, but I would say somewhere around $45,50, $45, something like that. It all depends on your local sales tax. Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And then Sarah, this phone number that I have, would I be able to contact you guys? Because I do want to talk to my wife and just kind of share some of the information you shared with me. Sure. Let me get a couple of pieces of information from you and I'll text you my contact information. And you and I will work together throughout the process. And then you can text me questions, but I'll go ahead and send you over like pictures of mom and dad and that kind of thing at this time. Just need to get an email address for you. Yeah, absolutely. It's Zavin, Z as in zebra, A as in apple, V as in Victor, E as in elephant, N as in Nancy, and then Mike, M-I-K-E. A as in apple, after the Mike, at gmail.com. So ZavinMikeA at gmail.com. Got it. Okay. And your first name? Zavin, Z-A-V-E-N. You can call me Mike though, Sarah. Hi, Mike. And your last name? R-A-T-U-N-A-R-U-T as in Tom, Y-U-N as in Nancy, Y-A as in apple, N as in Nancy. R-A-T-U-N-Y-U-N as in Nancy, Y-A as in apple, N as in Nancy. R-A-T-U-N-Y-U-N as in Tom, Y-U-N as in Nancy, Y-A as in apple, N as in Nancy. R-A-T-U-N-Y-U-N. Got it. All right. And you said you're in California, northern or southern? Southern. Southern. Okay. All right. Got everything in here. Let me go ahead and save this. So I am going to text you over my contact information. Now the text message that I send you, that's my textable number. That's the best way to reach out because you can then, you know, just even simple questions or what have you as you and your wife discuss it. Once you know for sure that this is what you want to do, I always tell people, text me right away and say, we want Fletcher. And then that way I can put Fletcher on a reserve until you and I can get on the phone and finalize everything. So that way he doesn't get sold to anyone else in the meantime. So I'm going to send you over my contact information right now via text. Then I'm going to send you a picture of Fletcher, mom and dad. So here's Fletcher, mom and dad. All right. Mom is your labradoodle and dad is your poodle. You'll be able to distinguish them. And then I'm going to send over, so it's on your phone, the link for Fletcher's page. And I'm going to send you all of his pictures. I have eight of them. And I'll send you all of his pictures so that you have them all and you can really go through them all and take a look at him thoroughly. All right? Okay. Perfect. Sounds good. All right. So after you chit-chat and discuss, again, if you have any questions, if it's an easy question, just text it over and I'll respond. If it's a lengthy question, we'll jump on the phone and we'll get it all figured out. And then once you're ready, I'll assist you through the process and then I'll take care of it on the backside afterwards. All right? All right. Perfect. All right. Okay. You have a great afternoon and keep me posted. You as well. Thank you, Sarah. I appreciate all the information. Of course. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer called to inquire about a Labradoodle puppy named Fletcher, including information about his health, hypoallergenic traits, and transportation fees.

"Hello? Hi, is this Diane? Yes, it is. Hi Diane, my name's Lynn. I was calling you from Puppy Spot and I was about Riley. You know, you're the second person to ask me about her today. Oh my god, where is she located? Well, we're a private breeder network, so we work with breeders all over the country, our puppies. She comes from a breeder that's in Indiana. She comes from, she's nine weeks, there was seven in the litter. Breeder says she's kind of on the smallest side in the litter, but that doesn't really mean anything. The smallest can end up to be the biggest, but they're not very big. I mean, they're miniatures. So mom is, yeah, mom is of course a golden doodle and dad's a poodle. Mom's about 20 pounds, dad's about 14 to 15. Ah, perfect. Yep. So now, I've never- Looks like a stuffed animal. She's just too cute, like just too cute on every level. I've never adopted dog from a breeder. I'm more on the rescue side of things, you know? So this would be something different in that aspect. That's the only thing- Well, it is also fun to get a puppy and start from scratch. I did. Our last dog we got at eight weeks. We just got so lucky with little Chloe. It was just, she was our heart. Oh my gosh. And I just, I fell in love with Riley. Oh my, I was just sending pictures to my daughter. Right? I mean, look at that face. Look at that face. So how does it work? So, like, because the dog's in Indiana, I can't just go there to meet the doggie, you know, to see- That's not something, you know. So again, we're a breeder network. If you decide you're interested, we do have delivery options. You're obviously in California, puppy's in Indiana. We do delivery for the puppies. Yes. And it's a standard flat rate. I was looking at the website. Well, let me, if you just let me, I'll explain. So for the puppy, yeah. Give me one quick second. So she has to go to the vet. We don't send puppies home unless they go to the vet, get health check, get vaccinated and get what's called a state issued health certificate. So the travel combined with the health certificate is $711. That's what that is combined. That means that, well, at this distance, obviously she would fly. They always try and get the puppies to the closest airport to you. I imagine that's San Francisco. Yeah. It's 10 minutes from my house. Well, I can't guarantee an airport. I'm just explaining that. They always try and get it to the closest. It's American Airlines. The other thing is that not every flight takes puppies, you know, so, so it's the pet safe program. You know, they're in a special airline approved carrier there in a area of the plane. If they travel the same way we do, it's climate controlled, it's pressurized. And but they are, you know, they are in a separate in a separate area, but it is exactly the way we travel. I'll explain this. We've been doing this for 16 years. When we started this website 16 years ago, it was kind of a nightmare getting puppies. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because the airlines kind of govern themselves. And to be honest with you, a lot of them put them in cargo. Yeah. But several years ago now, about 10 years ago, USDA took over transporting of pets. So the airlines were no longer up to their own resources. They have to follow strict rules. And there's only one way they can do it. And so and they get inspected, the USDA inspects the breeders. And so they have to file a lot of paperwork. It's not the same as it was. So that's why we're comfortable with it. Mm hmm. Got it. Okay. Wow. Well, I tell you, I'm in love with this little doggy. And yeah, I told you, did I tell you this? She's actually had 1100 people viewing her on the website. Oh, I believe it. I believe it. Yeah, she's extremely cute. And she has any. Her parents are very, very cute. Her mom is also a red doodle. And her dad is a red poodle. So Oh, so so a doodle and a poodle. So what? That's an f1. That's an f1. B. What's that? Second generation? It's nothing crazy. It means second generation. It means her mom's a doodle her dad's a poodle. So they come in f1, which is 5050, which would be a golden retriever to a poodle, or f1 B, which is the most popular, which is a doodle bred back to a poodle. Because if you have an f1 chances are you can't you're not going to have a mini. All right, because it's golden retrievers are a large breed. So even if you bring it to a small poodle, it's still going to be close. It's going to be like a mid sized. Yeah, exactly. Correct. Correct. Exactly. Right. So So, so this doggy will be maybe 10. I have I have no I cannot possibly estimate. All I can tell you is I don't want somebody coming back and saying but Lynn promised me she'd be 15 pounds. You know, I don't go there. Right. Our, our last doggy was like about 18 pounds. She might be dead or she might be 20 or she might end up being 16. You know, there's no Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, um, oh my goodness. She's just my heart already. I'm like, her eyes is what I know. Chloe magic guy. Yeah, it's it's the eyes that got me and our last dog her eyes you they you look in her eyes and they just melt your heart. She had these special kind of eyes I can't explain but even even when she was 15 people she couldn't really walk anymore so we would put her in her little stroller just to get her out. And even walking by would always stop us ago. Oh my goodness, how old is your puppy? Right. But she had the cutest little baby face. We just miss having a dog. I know. Oh, no, I do know. I absolutely understand. Yeah. And Frida says mom is very easygoing a real love bug. Dad likes to run likes to play likes to sleep likes to hang out. Very, very sweet nature. He says about Chloe was that way too. She was such a good baby. She just was so docile, super smart. I taught her everything because she was our first dog. And I read everything I could get my hands on and I taught her everything I had. She met over 100 dogs in the first year. You know, we took this doggy was went everywhere with us and did everything with us all the time. And she would I would even take her grocery shopping and I'd sit her in the car and she would just sit there. Oh, just say a word. Yeah. One other thing. She is microchip. And we Oh, good. Yeah. We have we have that program with a KC. You pay the additional 49 bucks, they're going to register her to a KC as a companion. They're going to register the microchip for a lifetime registration. It's called a KC reunite. And it's a really good program. We had that too. Yeah, exactly. And we offer it to the $49 which is a good deal because you also gain a KC registration. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So you know, not pure bread, but you know what I mean? Yeah. So so her little her little disposition now and she's only eight weeks old. So it's hard to say but she's not hard to say but yeah, the breeder Yeah, the breeder does say you know, let me see breeder says she is, of course being socialized. She is the most of our breeders do what's called neurological stimulation and they get the puppies used to normal sounds around the house like the TV, the radio, the bathroom cleaner, they get them used to being around children. Most of our breeders will do that. And if you her video was funny. I don't know what she's trying to do. She's trying to Yeah, there's she's trying to figure out about that toy and she goes to the beginning to the end of the toy. And then she goes back. But what's funny is that the tail never stops. Her tail is going the whole time. Yeah, her tail is just going a mile a minute the entire time. Curious, curious. She's very curious. Checking out everything on the floor. Checking it every end of it and then she actually lies down on one toy. She's funny. She goes from one to the other and checks them all out. But what's funny is how the tail the tail goes. Yes, it's it's funny because the breeder keeps putting more stuff in front of her so she's going. What's this one? Yeah. So so now out the door, it's going to be about a little under 5000. It will be I'll tell you. It will be no be less than that. Out the door with everything because I can get your $300 discount. It's going to be give or take. I can't do exacts with tax and travel but it's about about 3900 with everything. Okay, okay. Tax, travel, microchip registration, the whole shebang, status of health certificate, microchip registration, everything. So can I have a conversation with my family tonight and call you back tomorrow? You can but let me explain something and you certainly can but she has had over 1000 people viewing her so and Sunday nights are extremely busy. So yeah, you can but there's always a chance she might be gone. Oh, jam. So I have to make my decision now basically. Well, you know, if you want to talk to them and give me a call right back, you can do that. Yeah, can I can I do that? Can I? I'm sending you my contact info in an email. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I would like I want to just just touch base and just let everybody know and show them the picture and just so we're all okay. I just sent you my contact info. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. I'll give you a call back in about 15. I'm here. No problem. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right. Okay, bye.

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. Paul, how can I help you? Yes, I had, you know, I was looking for a little dog and I had, I guess, Zach. Do you know Zach? Depends on what breed Zach is. Well, he's Chavonese. That's what I was looking at. And it's, I have a number, 729-345. So bear with me just for a second. I'm sorry, your first name? Rosalie. Rosalie, how are you today? I'm good. I am trying to figure out how we go about this. So what we, so what we are is we're a national network for breeders. So breeders have to apply to work with us. We put them through a very strict screening process. We actually reject over 90% because they don't meet our standards or our guidelines. But those standards and guidelines are what allows us to provide a 10-year health guarantee on our pups, which is the best in the pet industry. And that covers anything hereditary or congenital. So for instance, with Zach, he is being raised in the home of the breeder. So he's being exposed to everything that goes on in the course of a normal day. He's also being socialized with children, with other dogs, and he would be coming to you from our breeder in Indiana. So if you decide that you want to purchase Zach, what would happen is we would go through some acknowledgments. We want to make sure we set the proper expectations. We would review the travel, and then I send you a payment link. Payment link would come to you in your email. We only accept major credit cards, debit cards, or regular PayPal. Once the pup is paid for, secured as yours, we then schedule the puppy's final vet exam. Our veterinary staff reviews that to make sure there are no issues and nothing noted, because again, there's a 10-year health guarantee. And then we confirm the travel. So usually you're looking at about two weeks for that puppy to get home, because we are at the mercy of- Home to where? My house? So it would be to a public location near you. All right, because I would have to see him in person. So then our service wouldn't be for you, because with us, there is no meet and greet prior to purchase. Because again, our puppies are all over the country in the home- So you have to pay for him up front? Correct. And then you send him to a breeder near me? No, we would travel him to a public location near you. You would meet our transporter, and they would hand you your puppy. Oh, okay. Well, that's hard. I love him. I love the way he looks and everything. But I should be able to at least hold him or something before I meet him. And again, we've been doing this for 18 years this way now. And it's just the way we do it. Because again, puppies are all over the country. So it just depends on the pup you select. And then it's really just up to you whether we're the service for you. And he's 12 weeks old? Correct. And he's in Indiana. Indiana. Isn't it unusual that 12 weeks have gone by and no one's bought him? No. A lot of our puppies don't go until they're 14, 16 weeks. It really depends on what someone- I mean, he's just adorable. I was looking for a black and white, but I saw him and I fell in love with him. But I can't, I don't, I have to think about whether I can- No, that's fine. I mean- What I'm going to do is I'm going to send you an email that's titled, Your Pup with Perks. And that's going to go over everything. The travel options, the health guarantee, the microchipping, everything that's involved in bringing one of our pups home. And I'm going to also send you all of his pictures just so that they're in your email and you don't have to fish through the website. But let us know what you decide. Like I said, we understand, we know we're not for everyone, but this is just the way we've been doing this now for, again, over 18 years. We've been on Good Morning America. We've been on Fox and Friends. Both news programs have us on to help educate their viewers based on what we do and how we do it. Well, now, on Zach, he's just got the cutest face. He is a full breed, right? Oh, yes. Yep. He's a Havanese. Havanese. Because my little Westie that I just buried after 14 years had that same face. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. He had that same pretty little face. And how big is the biggest he would get? So you're looking at, his dad is 12 to 14, mom is only 9 to 8. As of yesterday, he was 4 1⁄2 pounds. He's probably going to be right around that 12 pound mark. Yeah, because his father was at 12. That's cute. Jake was supposed to be 22 pounds, but it was a little more than that. That was my dog that I just buried. I didn't bury him. I have him here. I mean, I was looking at this. The reason why I started looking at this particular breed was because I went to Maine and I was with my grandsons and we were looking at this fort that they have there and we saw these dogs and we fell in love with them. And the dog was black and white and I said, that's my next dog. So I came home and I'm looking through them. Of course, the pictures, I couldn't put my pinpoint on it, but there's a place in Rhode Island I would have driven. It's a two hour ride down there, but you know, you have to have an appointment. And I thought they were sort of associated with you because that's who I originally applied to. And then I came across Zach and I said, oh my God, he's just so cute. But yeah, take a look at the information I sent you and then just let us know. One thing with dogs... There's nothing wrong with them, right? No, absolutely not. Gone for 12 weeks. Plus he's going to get a complete nose to tail vet exam before he's released to travel home as well. All right. Well, you... Okay. You're going to send me that paperwork on the email? Yep. I sent you two emails, review that. And then after you look that over, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out. If you decide you want to move forward, the whole process on the phone takes about 10 minutes. I email you the payment link and then once the payment's made, that gets the ball rolling to get the pup home to you. Okay. And it's the whole thing you pay right away or do you pay half and then half? No, the whole... It's total payment before they move forward. Both dogs that I own now, I got through Puppy Spot so I can actually speak from experience because I've been through the process twice myself. You looked at their picture and you ended up bonding with them right away? Yep. Absolutely. It was just something about them. It says the price is $2,699. Is that the price including the transport? No. So travel is in addition, but you're fortunate also because you're in New Hampshire, you don't pay any sales tax. Everybody else, we have to also do sales tax based off of their zip code. So the travel cost, it's actually more than just the travel because the final vet exam, the state issued health certificate in your name, and there's a couple of other things that are required for the pup to travel and travel are all balled together. So that cost is $711 on top of the price of the puppy. Wow. It seems like a lot. I didn't understand what they said about the papers. I had to take a little quiz on something and it said, I understand that the papers... I don't know what that meant. So AKC registration? He is registered. I see AKC. Oh yes, AKC. Yeah. So there's really no question about that? No. So with our 10 year health guarantee, there is a disclaimer because we're in the business to provide pet and companion animals. We're not here for breeding stock or breeding purposes. So if you were to breed a dog you purchased from us, it does void that health guarantee. So that's something, and it's a companion registration with the AKC, which means that as far as breeding, you're not able to breed. Okay. I didn't care about that. I was just wondering what they meant, but I understand that the papers are not... That there are some papers and there aren't some papers. I didn't understand that question. Huh. But it doesn't look... Yeah, I don't know what that was. It looks like it's a mood... It looks like a mood issue because he is registered. He must have papers. Exactly. Right. So basically what it comes with is either... So puppies come with either a full registration or a limited registration. The limited registration just means that there are no breeding rights with the papers. Oh, I see. That's what that said. Full registration or limited. All right. I didn't know what that meant. So he's limited because you can't breed them. Correct. Because if you do, it voids the health guarantee. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm looking at the face and it's kind of hard to resist him. Well, just let me know. Go over the information. I will. And then if you have any questions or you decide, just give me a call back. And your number's on there? Yep. Same number you called. And your name is? My name is Paul. Okay. So the same number you called is going to come right back to me because your information is logged under my name. So now you're kind of stuck with me. And are you in Missouri too? I am not. I am in Florida. I'm actually originally from Massachusetts, but I've been in Florida now for 12 years. Where are you in New Hampshire? Well, I'm really from Massachusetts too. I'm in Fremont, which is right near Raymond. Yep. So I just moved up here after my... I grew up in a little town of where? Outside of Springfield. Oh, I grew up in Revere, Mass. I'm sure you've heard of me. Oh, yeah. Revere. I know Revere well. So... Oh, well, my husband died six, seven years ago. I moved up here because my children are up here. So I have a condo and it's huge. So we're not worried about anything about space. But I just was hoping that I would be able to hold them and stuff before I brought them. Yeah, no, I understand. I'm looking at their face and I'm thinking, he's not Jake. I said to myself, don't get another Westie because I've had three. And you're going to think it's Jake and that's not the... It's not Jake. No, it's not fair to you and it's not fair to the new puppy. Yeah, no, so he won't be Jake. He's going to be... Well, his name is Zach. I wanted to name him George, but I like the name Zach. Well, either way, because the names on the website are for website purposes only. So our breeders don't even call them by that name. It's good boy, good puppy. They wiggle at them, they kiss them because they know that 99% of the time when they go to their permanent home, people are changing the name anyway. Well, I do love them. So it's looking really good. Just let me know what you decide. I will. Thank you. All right. Have a great day. You too. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about purchasing a Havanese puppy named Zach from Puppy Spot.

"Thank you so much for calling the Puppy Spot. This is Jordan. Hi, Jordan. This is Mariela. I have been speaking to Kristen and Ashley about getting a puppy, a golden doodle, and I have shortlisted a few puppies, and I just wanted to connect on some of those puppies and get more information. Is this a good time? Sure. Sure. Do you want to start with the first puppy that you're interested in? Yeah. One second. Let me pull up my account, then we can talk. One second. I wanted to basically know a little bit about the puppy's personality and their health and their parents, if you have that information. Sure. Just so you know, if a puppy is on our website, that means the parents have been completely health cleared as well as the puppy. In order to be on our site, our puppies come with a health guarantee for 10 years, and they have to be perfectly healthy. I'll be happy to go over the details of whatever puppy you're interested in, but just so you know, that's already been done prior to them coming on the website. Okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. That sounds good. I wanted to, I know that about puppy spot, and that's why I chose you all. So thanks for clarifying that for sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. So I guess my first one, first question generally was, so I have been looking at golden doodles and cavapoos. Can you tell me a little bit, so I'm trying to decide which one, can you tell me a little bit about their personalities? How are cavapoos different from golden doodles? Well, I would say that the golden doodles are a little bit higher energy, especially as puppies, and they're more intelligent. So usually higher intelligence equals higher energy because they need more stimulation. Okay. Okay. And cavapoos are more like, kill and less energy. It depends on if it's 90% poodle, 70% poodle, 10% poodle. So it all depends on a lot of factors since it's a mixed breed. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. So I was out of my golden doodle selections. I was looking at Miss Montana. She is eight weeks old. And so the website says the mom's weight is 20 to 25 and dad is 10 to 12, and she's an F1B. So what does this mean? It's a miniature F1B. What does it mean? Like how much poodle versus golden doodle? F1B means one parent is a purebred poodle and the other one is a 50-50 golden doodle. So it's a golden doodle and a poodle? Correct. So it's about, F1B is about 70% poodle. Got it. Got it. Okay. So I know it's hard to tell, but like what will the size of the dog be if mom is about 25 and dad is about 12? It'd be right in the middle. It'll be like the average of the two? Usually it'd be the average of both of them, usually. Okay. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about like Miss Montana's personality? Can you provide me the puppy's ID number? ID number is 732-428. So Miss Montana is only eight weeks old, so she is still very, very young. Okay. Very young. And did you get a chance to see her video? I did, yeah, where she was hanging out with a small little girl. She's very loving, very cuddly, loves people, loves kids, loves to play, very curious, but very, very sweet. Yeah. Yeah. She's super cute too. Yeah. And I was also, so for, if I, okay, let me ask about some other puppies and then I can ask about logistics. So I guess based on what you told me, I will go with a golden doodle over a Cavapoo because I do, I would appreciate like slightly higher energy. So maybe, yeah, maybe I will pick a golden doodle. The other one I was interested in was, what was it? There are two reasons. Miss Montana is in Indiana, just so you know. When you click on take me home and you go through the checkout, it will give you the different delivery options for that puppy, but she's in Indiana. Yeah. So for the delivery options, if I pick the option to have a local pickup, do you know where, so I'm in San Francisco. Do you know where, what would the pickup location be? No, it's going to be, it's going to be, that's going to be calculated once you place your order and our travel department is looking at different flights and options. So unfortunately they won't know that until we start to look at the different, just like, just like, you know, traveling, you know, if you, if you book a flight, you look at both combinations of the airport of the breeder as well as the customer. So probably will be, it'll probably be your closest airport in San Francisco, but I can't guarantee that because a separate department will work on that after you place your order and let you know within seven to 10 days. Got it. I see. And what's the typical time for a puppy to arrive? If when I place an order, say I do it today. Two to three weeks is typically the turnaround time for delivery. Two to three weeks. Okay. Okay. And the other one I wanted to ask about was Rachel. So the puppy ID for Rachel is 731-592. Okay. Rachel is seven weeks old. All right. Yes, she's an F1B as well. Very similar as Miss Montana. Let's just take a look here. As you can see, she's just smaller though, right? Because she's probably a little bit smaller. She's less than four pounds as of yesterday. So she'll probably be a little bit smaller, probably around like 12 pounds, full ground, probably anywhere from 12 to 14 pounds. 12 to 14 pounds. Okay. That is also a good size. She's still very, very young and still learning everything. Yeah. Yeah. How would you suggest, like based on the pictures I can pick, but how do you suggest like I take the call on which one would be a better fit for me? I live in like a one bedroom apartment by myself and I don't really have a backyard, but I'm on the first floor. So pretty easy for me to take her out for walks and stuff, take the puppy out. So I'm just trying to decide and I want to make sure I'm thinking about all the things. Do you have any suggestions? I think, I mean, even though Miss Montana will be a little bit bigger, I think you're going to be happy with Miss Montana. She comes from a little bit, in my opinion, a better breeder. The parents are certified by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals. She is a little bit more out of her shell because she's a little bit older, but I think it's going to be a safer bet to go with Miss Montana. She just seems like she would be a great fit for everybody. She's just super duper sweet and she's extremely healthy. She comes from, in my opinion, a better pedigree and her price is $400 less. So I think you're getting more, I think you'd get more bang for your buck, so to speak, with her. And the reason why she's less is because she's bigger. Usually the smaller they are, the higher their price. Oh really? Why is that? Yeah. It's just how it is. The smaller the puppy, the more desired they are because there's more people that live in small apartments than there are in gigantic mansions. Everybody can take a small breed. Not everybody can take a bigger breed. So that's why usually the smaller ones are more desired. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. There's a higher demand. Yeah. And I also, one of my friends who has a golden doodle, she was saying that it's easier to fly with a smaller puppy. Yeah. That's the other reason. Yeah. And with Miss Montana, maybe she'll be too big to fly with, you think? No, she wouldn't be too big because they're both going to be less than 20 pounds. Usually the rule is 20 pounds is the limit. 20 pounds. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And I'm seeing for most puppies, there's like, oh, these many people are interested in this puppy. And Miss Montana, I'm not seeing that number. Is that because she was on the website later or why do you like, I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. I'm not sure. That's a good guess. I'm not a hundred percent sure why she doesn't have just as much as, if not more people interested in her. Yeah. She's had over a thousand views and Rachel's had over 2,500 views. So Rachel's been on the website a little bit longer. Oh, even though she's younger? Correct. Because not every breeder lists the puppies at the same ages. Some of them list them later than the others. And you think that the breeder for Miss Montana is a better breeder? In my opinion, yes. I see. They do more health testing. They just do more testing and more things. Got it. And they're ethical breeders. Correct. Okay. And there's another Rachel or Rochelle, I guess. She is 731-593. What about her? She's from the same breeder as Rachel. Oh, I see. Yeah, they look very similar. Yeah. Okay. So they're like sisters, I guess. Correct. Okay. Okay. Okay. So she's just a little bit different looking. She's got more white on her chest and everything, but a lot of the similar characteristics that I was telling you before. Yeah. And also the same golden doodle and a poodle mix. Correct. Okay. And I have been looking exclusively at female dogs, but do you know how are males different? I'm sorry? I've been looking at female puppies. Do you know how males are different? Are males bigger? Are their personalities different? Males tend to be a little bit bigger. They tend to be a little bit more energetic. They tend to be easier to potty train. They tend to be a little bit more on the affectionate side. That's my experience. And females are less affectionate? And in my opinion, they're a little bit more reserved. Oh. Little bit more on the reserve. Both breeds are very, very affectionate, but males tend to be a little bit more like in your face type of about it. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah. That's good to know. Cool. Yeah. I think those were my major questions about size and they'll all come updated with their vaccinations. Correct. And these puppies, I'm also not... I'm looking for a social puppy, not a shy puppy. So you would say that these are all social puppies? Oh, yes. I think you're going to be the happiest with Miss Montana. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I might just put in an order. Thanks for giving me the information. Would you be able to send me an invoice? I know Christian had sent me an invoice on the puppy and I couldn't confirm at that time and that that puppy got taken. So would you be able to send me an invoice for Miss Montana? I'm looking for a local pickup and I don't want the pup pack. So just the local pickup and the base price of the puppy. Okay. If you do get a pup pack, just so you know, you would get a $300 discount. We have a promotion right now where if you get a pup pack, you get it for free plus an additional $112 off. So let me know if that changes anything for you and I'll be happy to keep it up. I didn't know about that. Maybe. What all is included in the pup pack? I'll text you a link if you get text messages on this phone. That way you can see a photo of it. It would be the small breed pup pack that you would get. There's 14 different items, all different types of toys, beds, leash, a food bowl, water bowl, blanket, everything. Oh yeah. I got your message. Okay. Let me take a look while you're online. Sure. Oh, cute. Okay. So they have a bed and toys. Pretty much you're supplied with everything that you need except for a collar. Since collars come in different sizes, that would be like the only thing you would need is a collar. Okay. But you do give a leash. Yeah. There is a leash that does come with your puppy, which is cool. And also a bag for... Yup. A drawstring bag to carry it in so you can take everything with you. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. I might do the pup pack. So how much will the total be with the pup pack? So with the discount and the delivery and everything, it would be 3387.35. And I'll send you the invoice now so you can see the breakdown and just let me know if there's anything that I did wrong, if there's any mistakes, anything that needs to be corrected. I'll send it to you. I'm going to say, confirm your payment for Miss Montana. Okay. And if I put in the order today, then maybe two to three weeks. Two to three weeks. Yeah. And you'll be able to download our Puppy Spot mobile app and track the status of everything as well as be able to call in or email us if you need anything. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. I look forward to that invoice. And then I can... Are you able to get text, like communicate over text? Yeah. If you want to respond back to my text message, you can just shoot me a text right back. Okay? Okay. Sounds good. It should be the same number as the other agents you've been texting, I believe. Okay. Because it's all the same system. Okay? Okay.

Let me save that. Okay. I already have your email address. And is this the email address that you frequently go to? What is it, the balloon 1968? Yes. That I filed? Yes. That's fine. Okay, okay. Because we do send you emails literally daily to give you an update. So I just like to double check. Yeah. That's the less crowded of my inboxes. So that'll be fine. Okay. So then you'll be able to see it. Because when you got a crowded inbox, man, that's the worst. No, I don't like all that. I kind of use this one for things I really want to look at. Let's see. Okay, so that's there. Okay. And so did you want to do payment over the phone? Or did you want? Yeah. Okay. So let me do. That's fine. No, that's fine. Let me save this. So we've got the taxes in there. What'd you say? You said you'd take what, 400 off? So I would. So I'm gonna take 300 off is the most I can do. Okay. And then add on that, whatever, that shipping or whatever. Just pay for everything now. Okay. So with taxes and everything, it comes out to 4,597.79. All right. Okay, so sending that over to you. And then let me open this link. Does it already? That dog doesn't have a license, does it? I have to get one in by state, right? No, you don't. So this, so Shane is, I wanna say Shane is AKC registered. Okay. Yeah, he's AKC registered, yep. So all that paperwork will come with them, right? Correct. So you'll get all of his paperwork. You're also gonna get separate paperwork for his microchipping as well. So you're gonna need to register both of those things. Okay. Yeah. Those eyes that are blue, it said currently blue. Do they have a chance of changing? They might. They might as the puppy ages. I know, cause he's so beautiful with the blue eyes. Yeah, that's why I like it. Let's do that to make a blue eye. Yeah, I bet they do think of that, yeah. Yeah, I bet they do think of that, yeah. Well, the name puppy spa and you're like 40, what is this? What is, that's what I feel like the bank does. Yep, I went to Cleveland and it did that to me with this card and I was embarrassed. Oh, no, but it's good protection. It's good protection. Yeah, so now what? So if you have fraud, do you have fraud alert? Is it set up through email or your text messages? I don't, I think I might have to call them. That's what I have to do. Okay, so yeah, just give them a call real quick and then they'll let me process it again. All right, I'm gonna call them right now. Definitely they're there. Yeah, yeah, I can hold. All right, hold on, hold on. Yeah. Let me see. The number's so small. Hold on a second, let me get by a light. And then there you go. All right, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna call them. I'm gonna keep you on the other line, hold on. Okay, that's fine, that's fine. Okay, hold on, hold on. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I would normally cut Christmas hair dry, but she came in with a matic today, so I decided to treat it first with a treatment from Goldwell. That way I would cut it wet with a razor and I would have to work ready and consistent with the same look to give her a healthy, shiny finish. She wanted rounded shape, a lot more volume to bring out her curls. So I'm cutting her fringe, pulling everything up over the top and connecting the short layers. Rather than just pulling everything down to the side, I'm pulling everything up over the top of her head where I can see the shorter layers at the top. You can see in the back, I'm literally pulling that all the way up over the top of her head, pulling everything forward. I cut her length off after cutting the layers, and this is the result that we got. A much more full, rounded shape that brings out the best in her curl, makes her hair look super healthy and bouncy. Wait, wait. So you're thinking of getting a belted Malinois. As your first dog, you have to ask yourself, who wants this toy more? Go get it. See it, right?

"Thank you for calling Puppy Spot. This is Sarah. How can I help you? Hey! I just wanted to see if I could ask you about what the appearance of a certain dog looks like. Hey! Okay! I'm thrilled with your excitement. This is fun. Hi! Well, I just posted a joke to somebody and so I'm sorry. Oh my god, you're totally fine. I love this energy. This is awesome. Okay, so Puppy, what's his name? Her name is Blue Bunny. Blue Bunny! Okay, hang on. I didn't even know we had a Blue Bunny. Blue Bunny. She's a little Frenchie. Blue Bunny! Oh my god! Oh my god! Blue Bunny, you're so cute! Oh, she's adorable. Okay, what do you want to know about her? Basically, I just want to see... Can we have pictures of her parents by any chance? Of course. In a heartbeat. Give me two seconds. Let me put this into your old lead here. So that way I can text them over to you. Perfect. And I will tell you about... while I'm waiting for this whole thing to reload here, I will tell you more about her. Yeah! Alright, so Blue Bunny, seven weeks old, she'll be available May 5th. That's when she turns eight weeks, which is a little bit less than a week. She turns eight weeks and she'll be ready to start her process of coming home. When she is finally old enough, or big enough to go home, when she is fully grown, she's probably going to be between 20 to 22 pounds in general. However, she was the smallest in the litter. So she might be a little bit smaller than that. So maybe in the high teens as far as her weight is concerned. As of yesterday, she was three and a half pounds, which is a good thing. That means that she's ready to go. And I have new pictures of her! Oh, yay! Let's see. She eats Royal Canin Mini Puppy Food. And this is her instructions. She's eating soaked puppy food with wet and cottage cheese, working on dry foods currently. She's been on a car ride. She's been desensitized to the doorbell, garbage disposal, loud TV and radio, and the vacuum cleaner. She's been around older and younger children and small breed dogs. She has no health or cosmetic issues. Let me go ahead and send over her, well, we'll send over an old picture with mom and dad first. So here is BB with mom and dad. Okay. There's the current pictures that you're seeing. Here are the new ones. I'm going to send them one at a time because I don't know if they've been resized yet. Okay. Because if I send them both together, they might get hung up in your phone. So give me two seconds. So there's one and two coming over of her current shot. All right. Mom and dad. Dad is the pan and the pan and lilac. His name is Johnny. He is a he is a show dog. It says Johnny is very athletic. He loves to play football, fetch and go for walks. Johnny has attended shows and has been in the show ring. Mom's name is Layla. She is not a show dog, but she is a therapy dog. Says Layla is says Layla is a diva and loves to dress up and go to town. She is a very passionate girl that loves everyone. She loves to play and be the life of the party. This puppy would be coming to you from Arkansas. And the notes say I've been breeding French Bulldogs for many years. I have a great passion for improving the breed. I have on a I have added I have on a very personal level with my attending veterinarian as he is available to me at all times. My animals have regular visits, regular visits to the veterinary office. My animals are also in a climate controlled loving room to play in in my home. Puppies come microchipped and they are very well cared for and socialized. This breeder has been part of our private network now for seven years. Let's see. Notes say as far as potty training goes, they use pee pads and going outside with mom and dad. Let's see. Parents are both AKC registered. Litter is AKC registered. And I'm not seeing anything. She is considered a blue with white markings. And then that's the story of Blue Buddy. And then how much would it cost to get shipped to Washington State? OK, so let me see. So here's one of two things. So being a snub nose breed, she has to either go chaperone or she has to go ground transportation. So if since it's Washington State, she might have to go chaperone. Chaperone is pricey. So sometimes I'll tell people to play their own chaperone, unless it's a major pain in the ass to try and get to where the breeder is, because sometimes they're out in the middle of nowhere. This breeder is in Arkansas. Let me see if there's a decent airport near them. The chaperone. So chaperone is so added to the invoice. So you have puppy. Then you have a veterinary health inspection. So about five days prior to going home, there's a full vet inspection nose to tail checkup for a report. The report comes to our vet health team here. They review it. If there's anything at issue, if there's anything that's not 100 percent, they call you and go over it with you. It's like a home inspection. At that time, if there's something health wise wrong with the puppy, you can choose to either get a different dog or get a full refund. You can thumbs up or thumbs down the dog. That's about five days before puppy comes home. So that's $287. In addition to that will be your travel. Now, if we have ground transportation from Arkansas to Washington State, which I think is a little iffy, it is $424. But more than likely, you're going to have to chaperone the puppy, which means that someone actually goes, a person like me, goes to the breeder with a little carrier and puts the puppy in the carrier and then goes to the airport, boards the plane and slides the puppy onto the seat in front of them and flies with your puppy to Washington State, gets off, hands you the puppy in the baggage claim area saying congratulations, and then gets back on a plane and has to fly back home. So you're basically paying for a round trip ticket for someone to fly the puppy to you plus get back home. And then, of course, the puppy traveling to you. So the chaperone is $1,600, $1,696, so actually $1,700-ish to do chaperone. So sometimes if it's logical, I'll say, you know what, hey, if you have the time, chaperone yourself, meaning that you buy the ticket because usually you could probably get a pretty nice flight for $1,700. But what you'd have to do is you'd have to fly to an airport and then rent a car to drive to the breeder to pick up the puppy and then drive back to the airport and then hop the plane and then hop back. And that's why the chaperone is so expensive because the chaperone has to do that. So I'm going to say that probably the closest airport to the breeder is probably Memphis. The puppy is across the border of Tennessee in Arkansas. How far is this from Memphis? Memphis, Tennessee. That's brutal. So it's a two-hour and 40-minute drive from Memphis to the breeder into the middle of nowheresville. And you're not any closer to Little Rock, Arkansas, and you're not any closer to Springfield, Missouri. Well, hang on, Springfield, Missouri. Springfield, Missouri is, boy, how did these people get out here? Three hours away, yeah. So it would probably require you, that would be a pain, to fly into Memphis, rent a cheapo car, drive two and a half hours, pick up the puppy, drive back to the airport, probably spend the night, and then hop a plane the next day and fly back home. That's a long thing. So probably 1696 doesn't sound too expensive at that point. So yeah, more than likely, because ground transportation from there to Washington is just not going to happen. So it'll probably be chaperone. Gotcha. Perfect. Well, thank you so much for all the information. Sure. Absolutely. So yeah, I would say puppy plus the 287 plus 1696 plus whatever your local sales tax is. So it's probably going to pop you an additional total, oh, probably an additional total $2,000 above puppy price. Yeah, perfect. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate the time. Oh, sure. No worries. Talk to you soon. Bye. Thank you. Take care. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': ""Customer inquired about a French Bulldog named Blue Bunny and requested pictures of her parents.

"Hi, may I speak with Deborah, please? This is she. Hey, Deborah, this is Jordan reaching out to you from the puppy spot regarding Zola, the golden retriever. Right. Hi. Hi, thanks for reaching out to us again. I appreciate that. I think there were a couple, but she was one I remembered. But did she out of... So did the last agent that you worked with show you how to see the distance of puppies located for me from the website? I didn't know that. And I'm in my car on my cell phone, but no, they didn't... I don't know how to do that. I looked at the filter, but it seems like you just have to pick the breed or age. Yeah, so I mean, it's going to be virtually impossible to find a good golden retriever breeder in California, so I won't take up too much of your time to try to explain it. Huh? What's that? Say that again? Why is that, that there's none in California? Well, many reasons. One, the sheer population of people that live there is one reason. I mean, you have the state with probably the most amount of people, tens of millions of people, and you have one of the top five most popular breeds. So people in California will buy them up really, really quick, so there's not enough breeders to cater to all the demand. I've been doing this for about eight years. It's very similar in New York, near New York City. So that's the biggest reason. Number two- Where are you located? I'm sorry? Where are you located? Me, personally? I live in Colorado Springs right now. Okay, oh, I like Colorado. Yeah, I have a lot of cousins there. Yeah, yeah. So that's a big reason. There's been a big mass exodus of breeders and other people because of the cost of living and taxes. And for a breeder to have a 50-acre farm, they have to be a multi, multi-millionaire. And- Yeah. I'm on a retirement budget, and I don't want to spend a thousand for shipping a dog, even though I want to be there. And I'm always one of those, it's old-fashioned, where you go look at a litter and you see the parents, and then you know what he or she's going to look like. Right. The reason why they put an end to that is because people were complaining. It's the same reason that they closed down all the pet stores. Going back to the sheer population, imagine living in California, right? And saying, here's an open door, come on over, come one, come all. Imagine the amount of people that would be coming through your door to look at puppies. Yeah, I never thought of that. I know, right? Especially for golden retrievers, where you could have 10 to 12 in a litter. Imagine how many hundreds of people, maybe even thousands, that would be doing all the retrieval stuff. Yeah. But you still want to see, even if they're out of state or, I don't know, whatever, but you'd still want to see pictures of the parents, at least to know what size. Yeah, we'll be able to provide all that for you. But the reason, again, the CDC cracked down on that because now they deem any breeder that has an open door policy, regardless if it's California or Iowa or Wyoming, they're automatically deemed a puppy mill because that's how parvo spreads, it's how kennel cough spreads, it's how a lot of different diseases spread. So that's why they stopped doing that. Yeah, I was encouraged from friends, you always have to really check out the breeders, and I didn't know why. What is actually the term puppy farm? What's the negative? Why do you hear that? Puppy mill, the definition of a puppy mill is any breeder that puts health secondary to profiting primary. So basically putting their puppies in unsafe, unhealthy environments just to sell them. Okay. And I noticed on Facebook, I went to two or three sites a month ago, and it was so hard to get them to answer questions. And then it was like, well, how are you going to ship the dog? And they wouldn't tell me, well, when you give us your deposit, then we'll tell you. And I'm like, what? Stay away from Facebook when it comes to buying puppies, at least, because it's all scam on Facebook. Yeah, I noticed that. When they don't answer your questions, it was just a red flag to me. Huge red flag, yeah. And they're in another country, they're pretending to be in the United States, the English is not their first language, so there's a lot of reasons why it's going to seem the way it is. So stick with puppy mill. A couple of things. One, in regards to your comment about shipping being $1,000 or whatever. So one thing, one, the puppies, even if the puppy was in California, they're going to be about $2,000 to $3,000 more because a breeder in California is going to have to charge more to make ends meet. So even with delivery, you're still going to save money. The delivery cost is $700 minus the $300 discount that we have going on right now. So it'd actually only be an additional $400 for delivery, not $1,000. So I just wanted to correct that before I forget. Okay. Is that by airplane or vehicle service or what? Normally, it's by plane. It's the safest, most convenient, and most comfortable for the puppy. They're in a private climate-controlled cabin that's built just for dogs. They're hand-delivered to you at your local airport. It's how I got both of my puppies. It's the safest for them. It's the most comfortable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I always worry. I've heard horror stories. You spend a lot, and then they pick up, and it's some other dog, not what they wanted. Then I worry about that. That's why you'd be able to get puppies by the organization. It prevents all of that. All your payments are safe, reversible, and you can get them delivered to you. I can't hear you. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I can't hear you very good. It got muffled all of a sudden. Can you hear me better now? Yeah, that's better. What I was saying is that's why you'd want to deal with something. Puppies Spot, again, has been around for about 20 years. We're an A-plus, better business bureau rated company. We're the number one place in the country to get a puppy. That's why you don't want to just deal with some random breeder that's going to leave you hung out to dry. That's why people use us. All the payment methods are safe, reversible. The puppies come with a health guarantee for 10 years, et cetera, et cetera. What about... I'm just asking. How do you find out genetics on the parents to be sure they don't have cancer? That's the great thing about our website. We go... Just to explain, I apologize. I figured that you went over this with you, so forgive me. With puppies, the breeder really screened it. I'm sorry? Yeah, it got real fuzzy again. I don't know why. Okay, try again. All the health guarantees are in here because genetics has already been cleared by puppy spot. Okay, good. This one I was interested in, how old is she now? Because she's been on there probably a couple months. The age is 100% up to date and accurate on the website. Whatever age you ever see on the website is always the actual age on the site. Zola is four months old. Her birth date you'll see is December 23rd. Okay, so she's been around. Now, how do you know... She came from a litter of how many and how do you get more details on her? That's why I'm calling, to answer those questions. Oh, that's why you're calling. Okay. Obviously, as you can see, I've been answering your questions. That's the whole point of me calling, is to answer your questions. There was seven total puppies in the litter. Her two cubs have been removed. She's microchipped. She's crate trained. She's been raised around large breed dogs, older children and younger children. Now, I have a question and it's a setback always when I'm trying to find dogs. I have two cats. They're both four, they're brother and sister, but one's really affectionate. They're fine, but that's why I decided I had to go with a puppy rather than a rescue because a puppy I can get them used to each other younger. Is that any problem or how do you know if that dog likes cats? Well, golden retrievers, the great thing about them, as long as they're raised in the right environment, they love everything. Golden retrievers are the most sweetest, gentle breed that you'll ever find. Yeah, I've had two. I had one girl for 12 years and I had a boy for 14 and they love all animals. I have a pig and I have two cats. They're interested in cats and the cats are very friendly. I just have to... I figured if I get a pup, it's little enough, I just train them to be together. That's right. That's absolutely right. It's just you got to worry more about the cat because the puppies are going to be very curious, want to get in the cat's face, lick them and all this other jazz. You just have to be very, very careful with the cat specifically. Yeah, I figure for six months I keep them in a separate room and little by little. I've done that before. I had two rescues, little guys, and within a couple months they were absolutely fine and sleeping together after that and since. I've had no trouble. But getting an older rescue would be a problem if they don't like cats. Is there any reason why she's still left because that's been pretty long? Yes, I know. In fact, her parents are certified by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals. They're I certified, heart certified, knee certified, and there's eight total certifications between them. The fact that she's still ill is, I have no idea. But that's the thing. Again, if this puppy was in California, the puppy would have been sold now, but the fact that this puppy is in Indiana, it's harder for that puppy to find a home versus coming here. Yeah. Is there any way to get pictures of the parents so I can see the size of what to expect of her? Sure. Some are really big, almost 30 pounds plus, and some, you know, the female. That's why I'm kind of going female only because I think they'll be a little smaller. But, you know, if there's any way to send the picture of the parents. I'll text you the photo. Okay. I'll text you the photos of the kids. And I'll also have to check your phone if it's okay. Yeah, your phone's really breaking up. Like, I don't know why. There's nothing I can do about it. I don't know if you can hear, but I'm sending it to you right now. Let me know if you get it. Okay. Okay. And, okay, let's see. So you said it's 400 to Shipper. Yeah, it'll be $411 and a $300 discount. Okay. Yeah, just text me the info because our phone lines are really busy. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. Okay. And I'll send it to you. And I'll send it to you. So, yeah. It's, our phone lines really gotten bad. Okay. I sincerely apologize. Okay. And you have all the papers. I'm trying to think of anything else I need to ask. I know Goldens with kids are great. I have a, I'm retired, this will be my last dog, but it's hard not having a dog, and I have, my daughter's always with me, and I have two granddaughters, six and nine. So that's why I really, I know retrievers. They're great dogs. Great. Oh, I have one question. Since you know about dogs a lot, I've had friends steer me away from an oodle at it because I hear that hurts their health. How do you feel about golden oodles and lab-oodles versus goldens? Well, I think they're all healthy. I think a lot of people add poodles because there's so many bad breeders out there that they're worried about... I'm sorry? Yeah. So, oh, our phone. Are you there? I'm here. I was just... I could tell you were speaking, so I stopped. Yeah. It's... I hear you. Yeah, I'm not hearing you good at all. It's like horrible. Horrible. Let me try to go to a different part of the house here. Let me try to go upstairs. Oh, my phone. It's not me. I'm sorry. That's okay. Is this any better? Yeah, that's better. Okay. So, it's like the glass reading cuts down on whatever. Okay. Yeah. So, I have an office in the basement, so usually the service and connection is not as good up there... down there as it is up here. Is this much better? Yeah. Yeah, that's much better. Tell me how you feel about the oodle at it. Yeah. Well, I like golden doodles and labradoodles. I own a standard poodle, and he's staring at me right now. So, I am a fan of the poodle. Yeah. But, you know, you can't go wrong with a golden retriever. That's for sure. It just... I'm happy. That makes them just a little bit easier to train, a little bit less shedding, more hypoallergenic when you add a poodle. Yeah, I knew that. I love... poodles are good dogs. I grew up... my parents had them. They're really smart. But I just... I know when I had... oh, let's see, it was in the early 80s when I had Tasha golden for 12 years. She was good. Then when I got Bailey the next 14, the vet... that's when everybody started having goldens. And, oh my gosh, the allergy. It wasn't until his later life, but he had so many allergies. It was like a car payment. And then she said hers and all of them that she was seeing, I guess because they're so inbred now. Right. That they were having more allergy troubles. So then I think, oh, okay, if you added a poodle to it, might be more issues. Well, that's the thing is... that's the thing is with Puppy Spot, you don't have to worry about the health issues as much as you would, like you just said, every single place else because we do all that professional screening. So people do not have to worry about potential inbreeding or a lot of other things. So, with us, you don't have to be as cautious because it's already been thoroughly screened and vetted, so to speak. I got you. Okay. And I know like my golden, he never even showed allergies until probably his last 10 years, well, last five years, especially. I guess, you know, that just happens. Okay. Well, okay. I know there were a few, I'm in the car and don't have it, but there were a few other dogs I was interested in. And I'll look, let's see, you sent those two pictures? Yeah. Because my partner wants to see the parents too. We're both really interested. Well, great. Yeah, absolutely. You won't be disappointed when you see them. I can tell you that right now. And if there's anything else I can... Yeah, go ahead. Tell me. How many pounds is her mother? What size is her mother? Well, you'll see, you know, we'll show you on the website too. I don't want you to think we, it's not there. Mom is about 60 to 65 and dad is about 75 to 80 pounds. Okay. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I can't see it yet, but I'm sure, but I'll just... Yeah. I mean, I sent you the text. Just let me know when you get it. When you get it, just when you, if we're not on the phone. Is there some way to filter size, like you said, to see puppy? Is there only, is there what? I'm sorry? A part where you could filter to see different size dogs? I couldn't find it. Good question. For the golden doodles and the Labradoodles, because they come in different sizes, like a miniature, medium and standard. Yes. You can filter by, it's called variety. There'll be a filter option that says variety. So yes. Okay. For variety. Okay. And then for the like golden retrievers even, I have to go to each one to see the weight. Right. Is there any way to filter? What I'm looking for really is a smaller golden, but a light color, but smaller medium. Well, the good news is, is they're going to all be on the smaller side for the golden retrievers usually. And the reason being is, remember I said we screen for everything. If there's ever any hip dysplasia, hip dysplasia is usually attributed by the bigger ones. Hip dysplasia is something that we weed out. So there's none of the puppies have hip dysplasia. That's why you'll notice a lot of the parents on our website compared to some other ones, like golden retrievers could be over a hundred pounds. You will probably never find any golden retriever parent on our website. Not, I said probably. So it's those small changes. I mean, a lot of dads are 80 pounds up. I see that. Right. Is there, just on an average, like I'd rather get a male, but I'm only making myself go female to get the smaller size just because I'm a little older now and I'm going to train it real good, but just less chance of pole mates. So I was thinking a female is less strong and a little smaller is better. You're absolutely correct in that thinking. You would be a hundred percent accurate with that type of assumption. So yes, the females are typically lower weight. And if you're going to have a litter, usually the females, not always, but usually the females are going to weight less than their male counterparts. Yeah. I don't want to get litter, but okay. Well, gee, you've helped me so much. You're the first person that's ever called me back ever. Thank you. Well, hang on to me and don't let me go, so to speak, because I've been doing this for many years and I take pride in making sure, as you can see, that not only do I just tell you the answers, but I show, and if you weren't driving, I would show you how to see the answers too. So it's an absolute pleasure. And I like speaking with, thank you for your patience with the crazy phone call. Text me your name. Text me your name with something. That way I'll be safe and it doesn't happen. Because I'm going to be looking. Absolutely. I already did with the photos of the mom and dad. So just, if I don't get a text message from you back in the next five minutes, I will assume you didn't get it. And then I will, what was I going to say? And then I will just text you again. I'll find a way to get in touch with you or send you an email. Okay? Thank you so much. Thanks. You're welcome so much. You're awesome. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye. You're welcome. Bye-bye.","{'Summary': ""Jordan from Puppy Spot called Deborah to answer her questions about Zola, a golden retriever puppy.

"Hello? Hi. Can I talk to Drake, please? Yes. It's Lisa from Puppy Spot. I'm calling about your search for a lab puppy. It looks like you're looking at Sherry. Oh, yes. Yes, I am. I'm looking for Sherry. I'm calling about your search for a lab puppy. It looks like you're looking at Sherry. Are you interested in bringing her home? Yes, I am. Okay. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. You're over 18? Yes. Like 10 years. Okay. You said yes. Well, that's good. That's good. Stay young. Every boy needs a dog. It doesn't matter how old you are. Yeah. 28 years old. It's okay. You live alone. Your first puppy. No, not my first puppy, and I don't live alone. Okay. Everyone who lives with you is on board with bringing home a new family member? Yes. Okay, good. So, Puppy Spot is a network of private breeders, if you're not familiar. And we've been around for about 17 years. So, every puppy that's listed on our website is coming to you directly from a breeder that we've already shown you. So, we make sure they have the highest standards in the industry. Sherry is coming to you from Indiana. Now, do you know the difference between English and American labs? No, I don't. Okay. So, did you ever see like these long, lean, like longer-faced labs, really active? Like those are the ones that are really active? Yes. And you know, like, like longer-faced labs, really active, like those are the ones that are used more for like duck retrieval? Not always. They're both family dogs. The English are a little bit stockier. Is this your cell phone? Yes. I'm going to text you so you can see what I'm talking about. So, here is Sherry's mom. And this is a great example of what a good English lab looks like. I also saw that you chose the option to pick up from the breeder. So, I'm sure you don't want to go to Indiana, right? Yeah, no. I didn't, yeah. Okay. That's why we call you, because I'm sure that you have questions. And if you've never been on our site before. Right. Here, I'm just sending you a text of the parents. I just sent mom. And here is dad. Oh, my goodness. You get both of them yet? I got, yeah, I just got the other one. Gorgeous, right? Yeah, they're gorgeous. So, she had nine babies. And there's children in the home. So, all the puppies are going to be socialized from the day that they're born. Dad has his heart and his knees certified through OFA. And he's had champions within the last three generations of his line. And the mama is just the happy girl. With that face. It's hard to see her well, because she's just smiling. To get a puppy home to you, we either drive or fly. Our travel team works out the logistics of it. And she'll have her vaccinations up to date first. She comes with a copy of that. And every puppy within the week of travel is going to have a full exam. So, the breeder's vet is going to check her heart, her lungs, her joints. Fecal exam, genitalia, everything. Because we also give you 10 years against congenital and hereditary conditions. We just ask that you stick her to the vet. Have her spayed. She's not for breeding purposes. Right. She's for family purposes. Your family. Yeah, yeah, definitely. We also want to make sure that everyone who you live with, whether you're married or a girlfriend or your parents, are okay with it. Because we don't want to send home a puppy. Yeah, to a girlfriend. Okay. And she's fostered already? Yeah. Okay. It will be like your first child together. Yeah. It will be our second. We have a husky. We're making a brother for him. Or a sister. So, he probably has a lot of energy to spend. Yeah. I know. What kind of ‑‑ how old is he? He's almost two years. He's a husky German Shepherd. Okay. So, maybe smart ‑‑ I don't want to say smarter than a husky. Huskies are super smart. But the lab, the shepherds really want to please you. The husky is not on their list of things to do for the day. Oh, my gosh. They love you. Yeah. Am I right? Yeah, yeah. She's very stubborn. That is a big trait of the husky. Escape artist, loud. She's definitely an escape artist. She's crazy. Yep. I'm familiar. Trust me. I know. I'm very careful about who gets our huskies. We get those first‑time dog owners that are like senior citizens, living in efficiency, and not very mobile. They're the ones that want the Hedgerian Husky. No? Yeah, no. No, no. But it will be a nice ‑‑ I want to use the word distraction. But a lot of the energy will be spent playing with their new baby. And your dog likes other dogs, I assume? Yeah, he does. Okay, perfect. So he'll also be a mentor. So he'll teach him ‑‑ her, sorry, good and bad. Yeah, probably bad for a bit. Yeah. But females tend to mature faster than males do. And the English labs are a little bit less active than the Americans. Still active, but a little less so. A little bit more manageable. So the way it works, if you decided you did want to move forward, we do a quick little screening. It takes about two to three weeks or sooner. But you'll get a travel date within seven to ten days. Our travel team works it out. They figure out if it's better to fly or drive. If they drive, you pick up at a public location. If they fly, you pick up at a major hub. Because the planes would be the bigger planes of the fleet, where the pet safe compartment is. Yeah. Do you want to know what the cost comes to if I change the travel? Yeah. Okay. Hang on. So instead of $287, it's $711. Oh, and your taxes aren't bad. For California. Yeah, right. Yeah. So everything, including the tax and travel, basically a starter kit gets FedExed home, bed, blanket, bowls, leash, teething bones, chew toys, squeaky toys. I would keep separate from your current dog so it's not scented by him. This way it's all hers. And it's specifically designed for puppies her age and size. That comes within about a week. That comes via FedEx. And then activation of a microchip for the rest of her life. This specific breeder doesn't chip. Probably one of the only ones. You can ask your vet to put the chip in. And it's like a minimal fee. And somebody contacts you to activate it. And it's forever through AKC. So everything altogether is $4,091.27. I see. Okay. Did you want to get her? Do you know if there's any Goldens around California, like closer? Golden Retrievers? Yeah. I don't have breeds in, I really don't have dogs in California. A third of our customers are in California though. Your state has very strict breeding laws that changed back in like 2018, 19. Very. Focused on rescues and shelters. For California. And then we add the cost of living to that. It gets a lot of very expensive. Sometimes I have like little dogs. But those prices are usually double. What the other dogs are just due to, you know, living in California. Right. I can give you a discount to offset that travel fee. I can do like a $300 discount if that helps. And there's also puppies that are priced lower than Sherry. Yeah, there are right. Aesthetically, you like this look? Yeah. Let me take a quick peek. You prefer a Lab over a Golden? No, there's either or. Okay. But definitely female. No, that doesn't matter either. Look at you. Okay. Hang on a sec. Okay. I personally have a Golden, but I also have a Shepherd. Okay. So I do have. Quite a few. So are you on the website right now? No, I'm not. I have a couple that are priced like a yellow lab. Male and female, 11 weeks old, gorgeous, gorgeous parents. They're a mix of American and English. They're $22.99. Oh, wow. That's not bad. No. And then I have others. I have another girl who's chocolate, also American and English. She's 13 weeks old. She's $23.99. I have a black lab, seven weeks, $24.99. So I definitely have a mix of American and English. I have a black lab, seven weeks, $24.99. So I definitely have ones that are priced lower. Okay. Let me email you a couple of them. I'll send you a boy and a girl, a brother and a sister for the 11-week-olds. They're gorgeous, by the way. Oh, I bet. Yeah. You have access to your email? Yeah. Okay. I just sent you the first two. I'm going to show you the parents. They're very, very beautiful. Let me know if you got my email. Yeah. Yeah, I did. Aw. I'll show you mom and dad. So cute. So Dixie's... those are brother and sister. Okay. Dixie's mom. I'm texting the parents. You got your husband in the background? Yeah. Yeah, I did. I just sent you the dad. Aw. Cute, right? Yeah. So they are $22.99. It's a big difference in price. And I can still give you that discount. Oh, wow. Nice. Yeah, that's not bad. Here, I'll tell you what the total comes to. And they all come with a 10-year health commitment, all of it. Right. Give me a minute. So before the $300 discount, it's $34.98. So it would be like 31 and change. Not bad, right? No. Do you want to see the other colors? Yes, please. Okay. And does it bother you that they're a little bit older? They're still puppies. No. Okay. Do you like black or no black? I grew up with a black dog, so I don't mind. Okay. Let me show you first Marcy, who I'm obsessed with. Let me make sure her parents are good. Oh, okay. Cute. I always look at the parents. Her dad is so happy. Oh, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Oops. I forgot to delete Dixie. This is Marcy's chocolate. Sorry, I'm switching out the puppies. All good. Okay, I just emailed you, Marcy. Dad's big, 90, 95 pounds. Mom's 65, 70. Oh, yeah. Mom's black and dad is silver. That's why I went, oh. And she's 23, 99. Oh, my gosh. Okay, she's cute. Mommy has a really sweet face. The parents look so cute. Yeah. Little seal. Yeah, doesn't she look like a seal? Yeah. She looks like she's saying, I didn't do it. It wasn't me. I'm sorry. Yeah, exactly. I'm really, really sorry. Let me see this last one. Do you want to see the black ones? It's all right. I think we want to keep it lighter. Okay. Dixie and River are my favorite. Okay. They're also Paisley's, but it's up to you. Right. Obviously. So my contact info is also on the email if you want to show your girlfriend. And let me know what you think. Okay, cool. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. And that promotion I can add at any time today, okay? Appreciate it. All right. I'll talk to you soon, Drake. All righty. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Lisa from Puppy Spot calls Drake about his search for a lab puppy. She provides information about the breeder and the puppy, and offers alternative options.

"Hi Puppy Spot, this is Liz. How can I help you? Hi, I was snooping around online and discovered a puppy that I thought I was very interested in. And so I just have a couple of questions. Are you in the Charlotte area? Charlotte, North Carolina? No, but we can get a puppy delivered to your area. What it is, is I work for a puppy spot dot com and we represent about 300 different breeders that we've screened and vetted and done background checks on over the last 17 years. So you're getting a puppy from a legitimate, reputable breeder. And then you can either go pick up or if you want us to arrange transportation, you know, we can do that. Which puppy was it? Let me see where they're at. Well, her name is Tilly. I have a number 725421. Is that helpful? Very helpful. Thank you. Oh, she's cute. Let's see. So she is. She's in Missouri. Most of our breeders are in Missouri or Indiana. So they stay with their breeder till they're ready to go home. And then, you know, if you want to go pick up in Missouri, you're welcome to do that. If you'd like us to arrange transportation, we have the option. I'd say probably about 90 percent of people have us deliver. It takes us about two weeks to coordinate her final vet check, make sure she has a clean bill of health, and then we'll schedule the transportation. So from when you pay to when the puppy comes home is about two weeks. And I've never done this before, so I'm just going to ask some stupid questions. No, that's what I'm here for. I totally get it. She is, you know, five months old, which is kind of an odd puppy age. Part of that I find appealing, but I wonder why she is that age. And then also, yeah, I would say, you know, poodles are not as popular as some of the mixed breeds like golden doodles or Bernadoodles. So she's a standard poodle. She'll probably be a small standard. Her mom's on the smaller side, but she weighs about 20 pounds right now. And I guess could from that, could you tell how big of a poodle she's going to be? I was kind of looking for a, is it Merrill? Is that the right name? Merrill Moyen? Moyen. Yeah. Yeah. The kind of in between the miniature and the standard. So she will probably be more of that Moyen size. She's only about 20 pounds at five months, which they usually have about 70 percent of their weight by the time they're five months. So I would say she might top out around 35. Her mom's about 35, so maybe, maybe 35. OK, well, that's within my range anyway. This is my, well, I've had three. Yeah. So I don't want to mix. You know, I'm looking for a poodle. I don't want, you know, a doodle or, you know. Right. You want a purebred poodle. Yeah. Yeah. Her parents are really cute. I can email those over to you if you want. Yeah. Yeah. That would be great. What's your email? It's Mo Camper, M as in Mary, O-C-A-M as in Mary, P-E-R. And then it's the number one four at AOL. OK. Dot com. Yep. Got it. I'm trying to think what else I wanted to ask you. So she is still available? She's still available. Uh huh. Yeah. You know, a lot of people like an older, you know, especially if they're older, they like an older puppy. They don't want to go through that little nippy puppy phase that's so hands on. And so the last one that I got was she was four months old and it worked out OK. The housebreaking was nothing. You know, she had already been down with, you know, and she just had to transition. Uh huh. And do well, this is another one of my stupid questions. Could you meet the dog before you? So not with Puppy Spot. So these are all breeders that we have screened and vetted and they're private breeders. So we don't give out their information. We handle everything for them. And then, you know, it's a different way of getting a dog. You know, we have all the information online and I can tell you a little bit more about the parents and about the puppy, etc. As far as meeting a puppy before you make a decision, that's not how it works with Puppy Spot. OK. All right. Well, I'm just out and about right now, so I'll go and look on my email then at the parents and I can call again. Yeah, my name is Liz. I'll be around all day. And then the process, you know, once you're ready to reserve a puppy, we'll go through an adoption interview and payment would be through credit card or PayPal. There's the price of your puppy and then the travel fee is a flat rate of seven hundred eleven dollars. The other benefit of getting an older puppy like this is she's fully vaccinated. So that's included in that seven hundred eleven. And how would it work if I wanted to pick her up? So if you want to pick her up, we just need about five, five to seven days to get her final check scheduled and completed. And then you can go pick up. She's in southern Missouri, kind of by Branson, between Springfield and Branson. Uh huh. So and so then you would go to the breeder for that. You would go near the breeder. They always meet in a public place. So, yeah. So we would arrange all that for you at a time and, you know, and you just need to pick up within two weeks of paying. OK. All right. Well, let me think about it and watch for the email. OK. Yeah. I just sent you two emails. So if you don't see them, sometimes the parent photos because they have photos attached, go to your junk folder. So if you don't see them in your regular folder, look there. OK. OK. My name is Liz. If you need anything else here, I'll send you a text message. So you have my contact info easy. And then if you need anything else, just give me a call. No, no. The process. All right. Thank you. All right. No problem. Have a great day. You, too. Bye bye. Bye.","{'Summary': 'Customer inquires about a specific puppy and asks questions about the breeder and the process of purchasing.

"Hello, this is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Linda at Happy Spot. Hey, Linda. How are you? Good. I can't complain. Have you ever had a Bernese before? I haven't, no. I have a mix, like an Australian Shepherd mixed with a bunch of other things. And he looks like a Bernese. He's like tri-colored, but definitely not a Bernese. So yeah, I have questions for you. Oh, that's funny. Yeah. Those Australian Shepherds, they sure get around, don't they? They really do. We did a DNA test on him last year, and he's got like something absurd, like 17 different types of dog in him. I guess like, yeah, like I think one of the parents, the mom or the dad, was mixed with everything on earth, and then the other parent was like a full Pitbull. But he's got zero Pitbull characteristics, which makes me kind of sad because I think they're cute. But Pitbulls are a great dog. It's the people that makes them bad. Totally. Totally. Yeah. But yeah, he's a sweet boy. Oh, good deal. Do you know anything about us or how we work? Or do you have some burning questions right off the bat? I saw, yeah, I was honestly just doing some Google searching today, and you guys came up. So I have like the general questions around like how you guys work as far as the vaccines and all of that, like more official stuff. Yeah, yeah. But I would love your thoughts on just the breed overall and her temperament, her parents' temperament and all that good stuff. Yeah. I mean, a lot of dogs have their fans, they do. They have a medium level of energy, and as they get older, they get a little slower and they like to lay around quite a bit. She's going to be around an 80-pound dog. The father's 100, so why not? Currently, she's 10 pounds at 13 weeks old. She's pretty small, even though she's somewhere in the middle of the pack. She's not the baby of the bunch. She's a 10-pound dog, well, a 55-pound dog, she gained a pound a week. And so if she was going to be 55 pounds, she should be 13 pounds. You see where I'm a little concerned? Okay, got it. 13 pounds, she's not even charting to be a 40-pound dog, but I'm assuming she's going to make up for a lot of lost time. I want to send you the pictures of the parents so you can see what you're looking at. Okay. Yeah, she looked like Paul to me. Yeah. Oh, she'll make up, she'll fill out. Don't you worry about that. Yeah. Let's see, the mother's in the green grass. And so she's got that cute little smile on her face. I love her. She's pretty. Aw, do you own the parents? No, I do not. We are Puppy Spot. And let's give you a brief overall view on us and how we work. We are Puppy Spot. We started almost 20 years ago in South Florida. We've always been a nationwide network of many different breeders all across the country. We created a need, we saw the need. If you want to go out and look for a puppy, how do you look into that breeder's background? How do you research where the puppy was kept? They don't let you into their kennels and let you take a tour of their stuff. There's no way they're ever going to let you do that. And so it's a problem. And so as more and more people were getting sicker and sicker dogs all the time and puppy mills were rampant, we decided we were going to create a place where you could buy with confidence and knowing that. Two things that are the foundation of our business, just a few things, but the two main ones is that we give you the no puppy mill promise. And also we back that up by guaranteeing the health of every dog for 10 years against all congenital and hereditary defect. We look into the background of every one of our breeders for a period of three months with our legal team. We have our breeders permission to do so. So we can really get in there and do a complete criminal background check. We also can find out if they've been sued for running a puppy mill or people have been suing them because they got a bad one. Things like that we want to look at. And we also take a walk through their kennels. We do a video walk through and we like to just pop in unannounced. They never know when we're coming. We just go there. And if they don't want to let us in, well, then that's our answer. And so we'll recheck their application. They come to us because it's very beneficial. We do everything. We do the advertising, the selling, the traveling, everything. And they don't have to have strangers wandering onto their farm. It's going to be a crazier world out there. And so people are just getting a little nervous about things like that. Yeah, I don't want anybody coming to my house. I don't know. Right. I don't know. Not anymore. Not today. Uh-uh. I don't run a petting zoo here, things like that. So it's very important. And so it's coming into the wave of the future. And I hate to say that terminology, but it really is because as we go down the road, we're finding out that many states are outlawing pet stores because of their practices of warehousing dogs and distribution centers and things like that. We find these things horrifying. And not only that, but they're twice as much. We used to be called Buy Puppies Direct back in the day when we first started. I actually worked here when they were Buy Puppies Direct. And boy, I tell you, they had a lot of hiccups and they were giving a lifetime guarantee. And they were just in their infancy. And so I decided to go in another direction. But I came back once they rebranded as Puppy Spot. It's a much catchier tune. But it told you what we did. You got them directly from the breeder and right from the farm. And so obviously because of that, they're not going to be in urban areas like city limits because of zoning laws, things like that. Nicole is located in Indiana. And so any puppy that's coming due south towards Florida way is going to be driven. And so most likely 99.9% sure Nicole will be driven to you. And we'll stop off in Georgia on our way to Florida because we can't fly her in 80 degree or better temperatures. This is why. And Georgia's pretty hot. Florida, I mean, Texas is getting driven. California is getting driven now because things are starting to crank up for the summer now. Okay. And those locales. So we're doing a lot of driving. My puppy was driven to me about four months ago. Oh, where is your puppy from? My puppy came from Ohio. And I got a Chinese Crested and not many people know what that is. But I was just about to Google that. Chinese Crested. He's a hairless dog. He's got a little horses type tail and a little mane on top of his head. And that's it. Oh, my gosh, that's adorable. I'm looking at it right now. Aren't they pretty? Well, some of those ones that you see are the hairy ones. There's three kinds. You got a one that's fully, fully, you know, coated in hair. And then you've got some that are semi coated in here. And then you've got some that are truly hairless. And mine is a true hairless. He's only got a little bit on top and a little on his tail. And then some, there he goes. And then some of them are, have to get shaved down. Those are the ones they put in the shows they have because they've got the thick full mane and the big fluffy tail. But it's really hard to get the one that I have, the true hairless really hard. Yeah, this is what this is what somebody who sells puppies has. Yeah, the most unique of them. Yeah. I tried to. That's cool. That's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But the Bernese Mountain Dog is great. A lot of people are going towards the Bernadoodles to a large degree because, you know, the poodle is a little more hypoallergenic. And so Bernese Mountain Dogs do shed. Archie! They do shed. And so sometimes Bernadoodles are kind of fun. You can get them a little smaller. But if you want a big old Bernese Mountain Dog, go for it. They're great. Yeah, yeah, we like big dogs. A friend of mine just got a Bernadoodle and he's like three months and he's just they just got him a few weeks ago and he's gotten comfortable and she texted me and she's like, I feel like I made a mistake. But I mean, she's very type A. So, oh, you know, she's got like a very specific way that she thinks things are going to be. And he's just in his normal puppy stage, like doing his thing. I'm like, don't worry, he'll calm down. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a very normal, normal part of getting a new dog. It's happened to me every time I get one. I'm like, oh, my God, what did I do? Yeah. Look at this crazy animal. So, you know, you know, she's the key, you know, on his level of understanding and training and whatnot. She's going to be the key to what kind of dog she's going to wind up having. So just like this one here, I need to train him not to do that so much. If I wasn't on the phone, he'd be getting a what, four in a minute. It'll pop out. So what do you know about the parents? Like, sounds like they're both talking about temperament-like, about the litter. Yeah, they give me a little personality profile to some degree. Also, a really good teller is Nicole's video. Did you see her video? Yeah, she looks pretty chill. They say about the mother, her name is Bridget. I like her little face. She said she's very friendly, loves to give kisses, and she doesn't know a stranger. So that's good. And then Bear is the father. They say Bear is a gentle giant who is cuddly and curious. And that's exactly what they are, gentle giants. That's very sweet. Okay. Yeah, Indiana, this is a gentleman that I really like this breeder. He's very hands-on. He also has basset hounds. I just kept thinking I wanted to get a basset hound or I wanted to get a standard poodle, and I was going back and forth, back and forth for months, and I was going to get a basset off this guy. And then I saw this Chinese Crested, and I lost my mind, and I owned him in 10 minutes. Oh, my God. Now you know. I wasn't looking for that kind of a dog at all. I would have preferred a basset hound, but I got this kind. He's very fun. You dealt with this guy personally, and you can... You're going to fall in love with whatever it is that you get. Okay. Okay, so it's a 10-year... It's a 10-year health commitment. Did I send you this email? Let me send this one to you if you're sitting in front of your email. This is called Your Puppy with Perks, and it's just loaded with great information in there about the travel options. I think you only have one, and that's ground. The things that we look at on the puppy before we send them home, before Nicole comes home, she has to go through a complete nose-to-tail health evaluation. We want to make certain she's perfect in every way before she's allowed to come home. We already know that she's great. She has no health issues or cosmetic issues listed, and so we don't expect anything major from her. If we so much as find a worm or a scratch on her, we have to call you right away and inform you of that so you can make a better decision. Okay. Right. And so she will be vaccinated when I get her? Is that right? 100%. Yeah, of course. We don't do that because we're nice guys. We have to do that by law. Okay. Yeah. She's already 13 weeks old, and so she's had everything. Your vet may want to give her an extra Bordadella shot. I know mine did. But she just had all of her boosters last week, and so she's great. She is ready to go. The only thing you're going to be responsible for is getting her fixed when she's, I would say, six months old, approximately. Your vet will let you know when she's ready. Yep, yep, yep. And then anything else, I guess, like on the breed, maybe that you have or that the breeder could share with you, just like what a perfect home for her looks like and what they're looking for in the home and the family? Do you own your home? I don't, but renting to own. Okay. Do they allow you to have an 80-pound dog in your house? Yeah, they do today. I'm going to have to adjust my lease, but I wanted to talk to you first before talking about the contract. Right. We'll do some screening questions before I take a payment for the puppy. And they're pretty much common sense things, like do you own your home, are you renting, are you owning, you live in an apartment. Obviously, if you live in an 800-square-foot apartment, I'm not going to let you have an 80-pound dog. Right. Things like that. And so it's just common sense things, but for the most part, it's pretty easy. Common sense things is all. Yeah. I mean, we have an 82-pound dog here today. Oh, okay. She should be good. Yeah. Oh, that's what you have, an 82-pound dog now? Yes. Okay. And you got a backyard that will accommodate the both of them, and the dog that you have is somewhat socialized, and they're good with other dogs. Yeah. These are questions you want to ask yourself. Yeah. And it looks like they... So my dog, he still goes on walks, but he tore his ACL a few years ago, and I kind of regret it, I didn't get the surgery. And he's still fine, and he plays, and he's active, but going for like... I like to go for five-mile walks, and I don't bring him just because... You can't. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to hurt his knee in any way. But it looks like for a Bernese, they do like going on longer walks. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. And so just like an athlete, you're going to build up to that. Of course. Of course. It's like a sports car, and I hate to make that analogy, but it's true. It's like a sports car. You can't just take them off the showroom floor and then open them up to 150 mile an hour out on the highway. You got to break that thing in. Yeah, absolutely. A little at a time. Yes. And so build her up like a little bit at a time, maybe. My little dog, I mean, he didn't go very far when I got him, but now he'll go far and wide with me, and he's only 13 pounds. Okay. Okay. Cool. And then Nicole, she hasn't socialized, right? I mean, is she with her? She's been socialized by young children, older children, small dogs, big dogs. They have not done any crate training with her, and currently she is 10 pounds, 10 only. So she's eating pawtry dry. This is a chicken and sweet potato recipe, and so maybe you want to put her on some weight gainer a little bit. It's called NutraCal, right? And so it's a weight gainer, and so it's like vitamins that you can just squeeze out on your finger and a tablespoon, and they'll lick it right off. They love it. They love, love, love it. There isn't a dog alive that won't eat NutraCal. Okay. So it's a nice weight gainer. If you want to give her some or just let nature take her course, she's just taking her sweet time gaining weight. That's all. Okay. That makes sense. What about potty training? Is that in process? No, we don't guarantee that. She's only 13 weeks old. They haven't done any crate training with her, and so her circumstance is a kennel with pee pads and a dog door. Okay. Got it. That's what her circumstance is currently, but she is going to a completely new environment. Yeah. Okay. So they said you're going to send an email with a little bit more information. Is that right? Oh, yeah. I already sent them. You've got all sorts of things. I've got one that shows you how we were on Fox and Friends and Good Morning America, pictures of the puppy, as well as that one I mentioned to you. So you've got three to look at. Okay. Great. It is. Yeah. Let me know when you're ready to pull the trigger, and I'll be here. Just send me a text message is probably the best way to reach me. Her pricing is very, very good. There are also eight other people thinking about purchasing her, so FYI, because her pricing is so good. Okay. And is there any reason for that, or is she just a good deal? No. Is she just a good deal? You know, there's a lot of supply and demand laws around here. And so back during COVID, Bernese Mountain Dogs were going for over $5,000. Now they're not, because the economy is slipping. You see? Supply and demand. Yes, absolutely. And so, you know, I still have some that are in the $3,200 range, and maybe even a little bit more. But for the most part, you know, this is a pretty good deal for her. Okay. And then in terms of the pricing, is what's listed on the site, is that inclusive of the travel cost? Nope. $711 for the transportation cost. And that'll get her home to you. Where do you live in Georgia? In Atlanta. Oh, perfect. Perfect. Yeah. $711, and that includes your $200 health certificate that she'll need by law in order to travel home. Unless you want to go and get her, you are welcome to do so. But why? It's expensive. Okay. Gas is high. Say that again? It was $711, and that includes what? The $200 health certificate. Okay. That's all of her health records. She's going to need that by law in order to travel home to prove that she's been vaccinated. Okay. And of course, there'll be some little Georgia state sales tax. And so it starts adding up a little bit. It does. Hold on one sec. Sure. Do you know if she will let people hold her? My daughter wants to know. Well, yeah, she's being socialized with young children and older children. We just can't show those in our videos because it's a legal thing. We can't have other dogs or people in the videos. Right. But yeah, she's hanging out with all kinds of kids. This is a breeder that we've known for a very long time, almost as long as we've been in business. And he doesn't have his children around anymore, but he does have his grandkids all over the place. It's a real family farm. It's a true real family farm. They all work together to make it work. And they've got crops and horses and cows and all this stuff. Oh, it's very cute. Okay. It is. Okay, cool. All right. So I'll just review what you sent and then reach back out to you regarding the next. Yes, ma'am. I'll be here. All righty. Well, thank you again, Linda. It's great to meet you over the phone. My pleasure. Nice talking with you as well. And I'll talk with you soon. All right. Let me know if you think of something else. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. If you think of something, text it to me and I'll answer you. Okay. Any little stupid thing that you can think of. Okay. I appreciate that. Sorry, darling. Have a good one. You too.

"Hi, it's Lisa from Puppy Spot. How can I help you? I was calling to ask some questions about a specific puppy. Sure. I need to know where she is. I wanted to go pick her up. I don't want somebody sending her to me. Am I speaking with Cindy Brown? Yes, you are. Okay, and you're looking at, let's see. I'm looking for Aza. You need her number? Nope. 733-124. Okay, and you've contacted us back in February as well. Do you have anything about Puppy Spot yet? You are a central that takes lots of breeders and you disperse the puppies. I just want to be able to go pick her up. I don't want somebody to bring her. Okay, so she's located in Missouri. Would you go to Missouri to pick her up? Yes. Okay, so the way the breeders end up on our website to begin with is they have to go through extensive screening and background checks. So we've been around for about 17 years. So in those years, we've developed a database of the top 10% of the breeders in the country. And she is adorable. So she's going to be large, standard size. You saw the parents. That's what we were looking for. Yes. Yeah. It said standard and it gave me a weight, but it didn't give me the height of the dog, of her mother and daddy. So the height I don't have, but I can send you photos of the parents if you'd like. Okay. Do you want to see? Yeah, that'd be great. Where in Missouri? I don't have the breeder cities. So basically the way it works, if you decided you wanted to pick up, you can pick up after she turns eight weeks. So she's currently only four weeks. So a week from the 19th, but within 24 to 48 hours, a puppy manager contacts you and sets up the when and the where. You would meet up at a public location. We don't send you to a stranger's house. But may I ask, you don't want us to deliver? I just always go where we work. My husband's with Delta, I fly free. I always go pick up my puppies. Okay. So I just pick them up and fly. Okay. She also has to be able to sit under the seat for takeoff and landing. Right. Is she going to be too big to do that? She might be. She might be too tall, but there's no way to know yet because she's only four weeks old. Yeah. If I have to drive, I can drive and come pick her up. Okay. So hang on a minute. So we used to work with Delta, but they suspended their PetSafe program, unfortunately. Yes, they did. Yes, they did. But we work with American Airlines or we also have ground transportation available. So we have a couple of companies that we use that are USDA certified in animal care. So Delta and United suspended their PetSafe program during COVID or around that time. So we have to adapt. We do what we have to do. So currently she's about four pounds. I just emailed you mom and dad. So the father's a standard poodle. The mom is a golden doodle or a sorry, a labradoodle already. Yes. Oh, actually the email, it has the puppy's pictures by accident. Do you get text messages? I do. So don't go to my email. No, it's not going to show you. There's going to be an error on the template. Yeah. Okay. Mom. Sorry, technology is not working. I know that happens sometimes. And here comes dad. She definitely takes after mom. Hold on just a sec. Oh, you got mom? I do. Yeah, that's what we want. We want that mom right there. I know she's gorgeous. So Ava's probably going to be a little bit curlier because she's an F1B and mom's an F1. Okay. So the longer the coat, the shaggier, but I like that coat. Actually, let me see. Yeah, she's an F1, the mom. So if you do want, I mean, she's on a 13 acre property with her breeder and her litter mates and her parents. She's going to be microchipped. All the health paperwork you're going to get with the puppy and she'll have a full health evaluation the week that you're picking up. So we have to make sure she's perfect and our health team is going to review the information to make sure that she's in perfect health as well. Again, we can arrange for travel or you can pick up. You just have to figure out how you're going to get back if she's too tall. Yeah. Well, if I drive out there, she'll be fine in the car. Okay. I decide to drive instead of put her under the seat. I mean, that's just for takeoff and landing. Usually depends on the crew. Oh, it does, doesn't it? Yeah. Sometimes she can cheat and sometimes not so much. It depends how much of a dog lover they are. But I mean, but look at her, as cute as she is now, imagine what she's going to look like when she's older. And you'll get updated pictures, Ashley grows in videos. Right now there's no point for a video because it kind of backfires sometimes when we post four week old videos because people say, well, she's not doing anything. Well, she was born a month ago. What do you want her to do? Yeah. Sometimes the breeders are like, you know what? Let's wait. Okay. Well, we get upset over all these added fees. We just want the $35.49 and we don't want to pay all these extra fees. I understand. So just to give you an idea what the fees are, number one, there's tax. We can't help tax. If you don't pay Georgia tax, you'll pay Missouri tax. If you're picking her up in Missouri, that is something by law we have to collect. Right. That's $269.82. Yeah. So Missouri, the tax rate will be maybe a little bit higher. I'll have to figure that out in a moment. Well, if we deliver to you, it's the $711 fee. Right. I see how you've got it spaced out. Yeah. So that also covers the 10 year health commitments that we give you, all of the vaccinations and the health certificates. Let me open up. You did a checkout. So let's see what you got here. What is the financing that you have available? So we have a couple of options. My favorite is PayPal. Do you have a PayPal account? Yes. Okay. So PayPal offers interest free, basically it's a line of credit through PayPal that's interest free for six months if you qualify. So they look at your credit score, your history with PayPal and your income. Credit score needs to be usually above a seven, but they look at all free things. So that's number one. You would apply directly for your PayPal account. You don't have to give a third party your personal financial information because they have it. Other than that, we have a- That's probably the biggest- Yeah. That's probably the route that we would go. The other option is a company called Terrace that we work with. So Terrace is kind of an umbrella. There's three lenders that work under Terrace. So you submit your application once and based on your financial information, they'll pair you with one of the three lenders. And the highest tier, I believe it's interest free for 90 days, like same as cash. Then you have to submit all of your personal information. Obviously, you're applying for a loan. But PayPal, if you Google PayPal credit, it'll take you to a link and you'll sign in directly to your account, which is easy. And let's say you don't get approved for the entire amount, you could always, I would send two separate invoices, one for PayPal credit, the other for whatever other payment method you want to use. You can do credit card, you can do debit, regular PayPal. It's your choice. I could send you three different invoices, four different invoices if you want to break it up. I don't mind doing that. But the $49... Yeah, we don't chip that much. Yeah, it's up to you. She is going to be microchipped. The $49 activates the chip for the rest of her life. We set it up for you. It's through AKC's Reunite program. And the $188 is a puppy pack. So everything that she needs gets FedExed to you. Bed, blanket, bowls, leash, I'll actually send it to you. It's basically a starter kit, but the quality is great. I just ordered one. We already have all that. I don't need that. This is not sent by another dog. Here, I'm texting you so you can see what's in there. She's going to have the house. We don't need that. I understand. Yeah, I already have that. Yeah, I already have a Morkie. We just... Our puppies are with us in the bed. She's not going to need anything. Mine too. That's okay. Yeah, and they sleep on top of me until they're at least for a little bit. Well, she's going to be back. No, she won't. Her potty routine down and such. I just sleep with them across my neck. We've had great Danes. Oh, wow. It's okay. All right. Yeah. This has not been compared to a great Dane. Here, I'll tell you. There is nine in her litter. So out of the nine, she's the... Her and she has a sister named Brittany who's also a blue merle. The others are not. There's two other blue merles, but they're males. And the rest are either black or brown. Yeah, we didn't want a male. We wanted a female. Yeah. Well, she's adorable. It's hard to find a female standard merle. It's just hard to come by. Oh, and her mom is beautiful. She is. Definitely a pretty, pretty girl. So if you did want to pick up, you're more than welcome to. Not a big deal. You can pick up within a week of her availability date. You just have to work that out. So that saves us 7-1-1. No, it only saves you $400 because the pickup fee is $287. That's going to cover the health certificates and the 10-year health commitment. So it's only a $400 savings. Okay, so $400. Oh, $424. We don't get the puppy pack. So that's $188. That's $588. Here, let me do the math. Also, we're going to change the taxes. Forgive me, I'm just a messenger with that. People get mad about taxes. They are not. It's not my fault. I know. We didn't always have to collect tax. It happened in the last year. Do I have to have the chip from you? She's already chipped. I can't get a chip here? Oh, that's right. You already said that. She'll be chipped. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. She's already chipped. She's already chipped. The $49 covers the activation. That's fine. And it's for the rest of her life instead of having to redo it every year. Yeah. Oh, the taxes are similar. Perfect. It's only 6.225% as opposed to 6%. Let me take this off. So $588 off of $44.97. I'm doing the math, or my computer is doing the math. Let's change this. And don't forget your time and money that you're going to spend on gas, flight, all of that. I got it. I got it. So the total will be, if you pick up, $4126.85 without the puppy pack. $4,000. Okay. Did you definitely want a Labradoodle? I might have something similar. Yes. Yeah. No, this is what we want. This is what we've been looking at for over a year. Right. And... Because I can try to find maybe something that's also a Merle standard female that might cost a little bit less. No. No. Okay. Let me talk to my husband about it. We just... Okay. Do you want me to put her on a two-hour reserve for you in the meantime? Yes, that'd be great. Okay. Give me a moment. Why did I think she was in Birmingham? I don't know. I thought I read something that she was in Birmingham, and I'm not far from that, so I'm going to be at ease with it. I know. That's why I thought maybe I could try to find something closer, but most of them are in the Midwest. You're all the way in Georgia. You have a lot of families in Georgia. I am. Maybe the cost of living is higher, closer to on the East Coast. Maybe that's why the price... We don't have that many breeders. But I'm going to take a look anyway to see what else I have. I thought I found something for 2000 that I don't think she had this look. I mean, you know if you love them or not. I think half of her face was black and half of her face was white. I think her sister's similar looking to that. And I think that would bother me over her. I know how much they change. They're going to change. My mama looks like that. Half of her face is black and half is white. Yeah, she does. She does, doesn't she? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, we could see her belly through her legs. I think she's probably nursing. I know. We're not judging. And dad has a funky haircut, but we're not going to judge him on his haircut either. A little too much off the top for Brightcase, but I'm judging too. Okay, if you'll hold her for two hours, we'll talk about it. You got it. You got it. And I'm going to look anyway. If I find something I found that was closer, cheaper, I'll let you know. I'm a good puppy picker. Okay. All righty. All right. We'll talk soon. Bye. Bye, Cindy.","{'Summary': ""Customer called to inquire about a specific puppy and wanted to pick her up instead of having her delivered.

"Hello. Yes, hello. This is Linda puppy spot calling regarding Presley the schnauzer. Is this Ed? Yes. Hi, Ed. You got a minute you want to talk about a fun looking dog? Well, I'm just wondering. Where is he yet? Well, I think he's in Texas. Yep. That's where he's at. He's in Texas. He's a nice small schnauzer and I would drive him to you. Drive him. I can't play him into Arizona. It's too hot. It ain't too hot yet. It will be. It will be by the time he's ready to come home. And so absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Well, yeah. What is this ID number thing on the screen? Well, that's his ID. Well, that's his ID. Right. And I. Skip typing. Well, I didn't want to skip typing. So but I didn't know what number they wanted me to put in there. Well, the ID number is next to his name on the website. So how did you find this one? Did you find him on the website? Yes, I'm still on the website. Oh, okay. And so every puppy has an ID number. Everyone has an ID number. So I've got a maybe about three or four Presleys. And so we want to know which Presley you're talking about. I have many puppies. We're a nationwide network of many different breeders all across the country. We've been in business for 20 years. Every puppy that we send home comes home with a 10 year health commitment. We stand behind the health of every dog for 10 years. And so, as you can imagine, we're very picky about the types of breeders that we allow into our network. Yeah. Well, no, I'm not a breeder. I'm retired. I live in Arizona where it's sunny and warm at times. And I just lost my miniature Schnauzer here a couple of days ago. So I was looking, kind of had empty spots, you know. Right. And so I see that you were interested in doing some financing. Is that right? Pardon me? I see here that you were interested in doing some financing. You clicked onto a financing page. Well, yeah, that's what I was trying to find out what the financing was. Because I'll probably just use a credit card of my own and finance the deal. It's probably your best bet. Absolutely. You don't want to pay for the dog more than once. Just pay for him one time. Right. Well, yeah, hopefully. Yeah. And so any of the puppies that you see can be delivered to you in some form or fashion. Presley's an older puppy. He's 20 weeks old. And so that makes him a good one because he'll sleep through the night. But he's still pretty small. He's only five and a half pounds. And so he's going to stay a small Schnauzer, a nice small one. And so if you do any traveling, you'll be able to take this one on the plane with you because he's small. How much does he going to weigh when he's fully grown? Nine pounds. Nine pounds. Well, this one's only going to be nine or ten pounds. Oh, really? This is really a small guy. Yeah. He's small for Schnauzer. And so that's what this breeder does down there in Texas. She breeds them small so you can travel with them. If you have a 16 pound miniature Schnauzer, you can't travel with them on the plane. Yeah. I won't fly on a plane anyway, so that don't apply. That's good. I didn't know flying on a plane when I was in the service that I had enough. Oh, OK. And then I used to live in Denver and got tired of the snow. OK. And when I retired from the company I worked for, I moved out here and I brought my tow shuffle with me just to remind me that the reason I'm down here and I haven't used it. I've been down here for 16 years. There you go. That's good. That's why I live in Florida. I'm never going back to the snow if I can help it. But you got all kinds of different bugs out there. Well, that's OK. Arizona's just a little too hot for me. That's good enough for me. But if you say that you like this puppy, let me know. I'll put him on reserve. We'll do some screening questions. Well, which one are we talking about? I need to get out of this website, right? Presley, the one I sent you. I'm going to email you pictures of him and I sent you one to your cell phone as well. You picked him, right? OK. He's a brown and white one with little polka dots all over his body. It's called Tink. It was Presley or Parker, one of the two. Yeah, both of them. They're brothers. Take two of them. They're small. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I don't. One of them, one, he was playing with a cat on the video. Oh, yeah. Well, let me see. I don't know. Maybe he does. I don't know. He's playing with the cat. Let me see. Yeah, I'm trying to bring it back up. Oh, yeah, that's Presley. Right. I see the cat rolling around. The cat is black. Yeah, I'm looking at him. I'm looking at both of them. And the one I had was Pepper and she had white legs and chest and a little on her chest and stuff and around her mouth was always white. Well, when I live out here in the desert, though, we go out and walk on dirt roads, you know. Oh, yeah. And then her her white hair was always black or brown. Uh-huh. Yeah. But what I mean about Parker is he's got that big spot on his nose. It makes his nose look huge. But it also makes him really, really cute. Yeah, he's really adorable. I like both of them. I do. I like the schnauzers with the ticking on their body. If you if I showed you the pictures of the parents, you would see what they look like when their when their fur is shaved. You can see those little polka dots all over their skin. Well, and then being that, like you said, Arizona's hot. They get trimmed down quite a bit on their hair. So it isn't quite so hot for them. Right. Right. Right. Right. So here we go. Pressley, I think, is the one I was looking at. Yeah. Yeah. He's absolutely gorgeous. And so he's you know, like I said, he's in Texas, but we'll drive him home to you. What about that knock down on the price? Well, his price has already been reduced by about he was thirty six hundred dollars when he was first introduced on the Web site. And so as he's gotten older, his price has been reduced quite a bit down to twenty four hundred. And so they've already knocked off twelve hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't hurt to ask. And so absolutely not. So now what are we talking if I was to buy him today, when will I receive him? Two to three weeks from today. He needs to go to the veterinarian. Yeah. He needs to go back to the vet. He needs to get a health certificate by law in order to travel. And he's going to be we're going to check him out to make certain he's perfect in every way before we allow him to come home. We already know he's perfect. So but we don't expect anything, but we must document that because we guarantee the puppy's health for ten years. And then so that's the liability of a ten year health commitment. Very important. Yeah, I understand that. I just. We're going to call you this time. We're going to call you from this time next week to give you the final itinerary and you know, if he's going to show up in two weeks or three weeks. It all depends how quickly that that breeder gets that puppy ready for you. Yeah, I just I'm sitting here, you know, I lost my girl. Two days ago. Oh, no. You know, I've got to go on. Well, it's pretty soon. But then right now I live here alone. I've got a house with a quarter acre ground and yard. Conditioned all that kind of stuff. And I've got a 12 year old dash. Oh, nice. I think it's nice. I'm the only one here now. Now you're you're betraying me. He's on the couch. Oh, well, having any type of dog is always a nice thing to have. Why is he hiding under the couch? Well, I just give him a bath. Well, I don't know why I don't go outside because it's 80 degrees here. Okay. Dry him off. But maybe he decided that it's hard to say. I got a doggy to work. Go outside. And so sometimes he sneaks out there and he's laying on. I got an enclosed patio. So sometimes he's laying out in the patio. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah. And so he might he might he might need a little companion. Yeah. Well, maybe. Well, I know being his age, you know, getting up there. Yeah. I know that feeling. I know that feeling, Ed. You never know. You don't really want to. I've had a dog all my life. Okay. I'm going to turn sometime or not. And so I just kind of going, well, I lost her, which was unexpected. I couldn't believe she was five years old and she had a heart attack. Oh, my. I'm sorry. That was very unusual for that young of a schnauzer to have a heart attack. Sorry to hear that. Well, me too. Yeah. Then I wouldn't be talking to you today. Oh, yeah. You know, it all comes down to circumstances. Yeah. I just I was looking at these and I go, yeah, I've been looking at I went to the kennel. The. What do you call the shelter, the rescue place? Yeah. Well, they didn't have they had a lot of nice dogs there, but, you know, I'm kind of I like the smaller ones. I've had well, I had a lab. She passed away last year. She was 13. Okay. So I just kind of I had three at one time and now I'm down to one. Oh, yeah. And so I'm just kind of looking at I was looking at these and I'm going, well, I'm trying to make up my mind. And I thought, well, let me see what's involved in this and where you were at, because there's, you know, this puppy spot there in Nevada. Or we don't have an office in Henderson. Okay. No, we're a nationwide network of many different breeders. All of our puppies are going to be out on the farm with the breeders. And so once you purchase them, we deliver them to you. And so that's the point. We don't want you to get them from a pet store or a warehousing situation. We want them to stay on the farm where they were born. And when they're ready to come home, we find that it's a much happier, healthier, better socialized dog and much healthier this way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We also collaborate with the American Kennel Club. And so, you know, as you can imagine, we're going to, you know, be careful about the types of breeders that we have in our network and how we get that puppy home to you. So we can stay in business another 20 years if we could. Well, I think you will. But I don't think I'll be around to see it. Okay. All right. Well, I mean, if you say you want to get them, just let me know and I'll start making it happen. Do you want me to give you a bottom line? Would everything cost on the way out the door? Yeah. Why don't you give me that? Okay. Let's see if we have a good idea. And do I need to put a deposit down on him? Well, if you say you're ready to get them, then I would send you an invoice for the entire amount and then you would put it on your credit card. I can't stress that enough how important it is that you put it on a credit card and that way your purchase is protected by your credit card company. Very, very important. Now I've got change. So they're fairly good. What is your zip code? 86413. 413. Okay. And I'm about 180 miles from Phoenix. Oh, I got you. Okay. I'm going to be there close to the Colorado River. Oh, that sounds like a nice location. You can go down to the river and there's casinos down there 20 miles from where I live. Oh, okay. So they got seven casinos down there. And so you can go have dinner down there in the casinos and play a little bit or whatever you want to do. You can take a river boat ride. You can rent jet skis, whatever you want to do. Sounds like a lot of fun. Okay. And now all puppies travel for a flat rate of $711 and that includes your $200 health certificate. That is the travel cost. And also there's some state sales tax at 5.6% for $174.16. The puppies cost is $2399 for a complete total out the door of $3,284.16. Expensive little puppies. Yeah, they all are. Any more they are. If you go to a pet store, they're twice as much. They really are. I haven't been in a pet store, but I live actually out here in the rural area. I'm in between, I don't know if you've heard of Bullhead City? Yeah, sure. And it's one of the hottest spots in the country. And I'm 20 miles east there in a valley in between Bullhead City and Kingman, Arizona. Oh, okay. All right. Just right up from Route 66. Okay. You want to think about it for a minute? Yeah, why don't you call me back and give me about 30 minutes or 40 minutes. What is the total of that? $3,284.16. $3,300 is what you're talking about. $3,200.32. Well, I'm just rounding it off. Oh, okay. And so you can talk with the people and see if you can get a little money off of that. Yeah. I might be able to get you a little $100 off. All I'm doing is saying, well, you know, I see he's been here a while. Okay. But he's still cute. And I guess probably a lot of the people didn't care for the color markings on him. I mean, they're all the right colors. I think they're great. They're the best ones. Yeah, I like that. I kind of like that. Mine was a rather standard one that you have a few there that look just like her. Yeah, why don't you just give me a call back in about 30 minutes. Okay, will do. And I'll talk to you again very, very soon. Okay? Okay. All right, Darlene. And take a look at some of these emails I'm sending you. I'm looking at firstly here. And so I got to get out of it to go to my email. Okay, good. I'll call you back in about 30 minutes. Okay. All right. Thank you.
